        In this section, we consider how we might compute probabilities if you knew other events took place.  This occurs often in our day to day thinking without us being aware of it. It may be that the chance you have the flu on any random day is fairly low.  But if you woke up one morning, with a high fever and a cough, then certainly you'd think the chances were higher!  It may be difficult to predict the weather in general, but by observing signs like cloud cover, wind and changes in temperature, one could adjust your own assesment of the likelihood of rain.  In other words, the probablity of an event occuring may change depending on what other events do or don't take place.

    <title>Defining Conditional Probability </title>

  <p>Suppose you rolled a six-sded die.  Let <m>A</m> denoted <q>the outcome is even</q> and <m>B</m> denote <q>the outcome is at least 4</q>.  Let's say someone rolls the dice, looks at the result, and informs you that <m>B</m> is true.  What now is the probability that <m>A</m> is true?</p> 

  <p> In general, <m>P(A)=\frac{3}{6}</m>, however, if we know <m>B</m> is true, there are no longer 6 valid outcomes.  We are restricted to <m>B=\{4,5,6\}</m> as our new sample space.  So we note that out of these, <m>\{4,6\}</m> are are even.  So the probability <em>now</em> that <m>A</m> occurs is <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>.</p>

  <p> We note that this <m>\frac{2}{3}=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|B|}</m>. That is, our of <m>B</m>, how much of <m>B</m> is <m>A</m>?

      We say the probability of <m>A</m> <term>given</term> <m>B</m> is the probability <m>A</m>occurs assuming that <m>B</m> occurs.  This is denoted <m>P(A|B)</m> and is computed <me>P(A|B)=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|B|}=\frac{|A\cap B|/|S|}{|B|/|S|}=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.</me>

  We can see this here with the following Desmos graph.  Initially, <m>P(A)=0.6, P(B)=0.4, P(A\cap B)=0.3, P(A\cup B)=0.7</m>.  We see that while <m>P(A)</m> takes up 60% of the <m>[0,1]</m> interval, it takes up 75% of the <m>P(B)</m> interval, so <m>P(A|B)=\frac{0.3}{0.4}=0.75.</m>  Similarly <m>P(B)</m> takes up 40% of the <m>[0,1]</m> interval, it takes up 50% of the <m>P(A)</m> interval, so <m>P(B|A)=\frac{0.3}{0.6}=0.5.</m>  Adjust the probablities, and slide the regions to change the overlap to see how that effects the values!

  This follows intuitively.  If at a resturaunt, 20% of people order steak (<m>P(S)=0.2</m>) and half the people who order steak order fries (<m>P(F|S)=0.5</m>), then how many people order fries and steak?  It's <m>P(F\cap S)=P(F|S)P(S)=(0.5)(0.2)=0.1</m> or 10% of the patrons had both steak and fries.  But without all of the formal symbolism, if 20 people out of a 100 had steak, and half also had fries, then 10 our of 100 had steak and fries!

<subsection>
  <title>Independence</title>

<p>Part of our motivation for studying conditional probability is to see how knowing certain events occur change the probability that other events occur.  In the dice example above, knowing that the outcome is a <m>4,5</m> or <m>6</m> increases the chance that the outcome is even from one half.  But what if there were events that did not in any way influence each other?
</p>

<p>
If someone were to flip a coin, it is a 50% chance that it comes up heads.  It's not clear what exactly the probability of a random person falling down  a well is,  but if they did, and from the bottom of the well, they flipped a coin, we expect that it would still have a 50% chance of coming up heads.  The falling down a well has no bearing on the outcome of coin flips.  We say that these events are <term>independent</term> of each other, meaning that the outcome of one event has no impact on the other.  More formally:

</p>  

<definition xml:id="DefinitionIndependence">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Events <m>A, B</m> are <term>independent</term> of each other if the outcome of one event does not change the probability of the other occuring.  That is <me>P(A|B)=P(A).</me>
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>


  <p> So <m>P(H|W)=P(H)=0.5</m>.  It is not always clear when events are independent.  The world is a complicated and chaotic place, and we all have apriori beliefs and biases.  Things which may seem unrelated may have subtle inflences on each other, and those we may assume to be connected may in fact be independent.  Thus it behooves us to be able to check if events are independent.   While <xref ref="DefinitionIndependence"  /> may give us one avenue, another would be:</p>



<remark>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Events <m>A, B</m> are <term>independent</term> if and only if:

 </statement>
 <solution>
  <p>
    There are several approaches. You only need to go through one of these to obtain answer.</p>

    <p> First note that <m>P(B)=\frac{8}{25}=0.32</m> and <m>P(B|A)=\frac{5}{12}\approx 0.41666667</m>.  These are not the same (being a biology major seems to improve the odds that you are an athlete) so these are not independent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next note that <m>P(A)=\frac{12}{25}=0.48</m> and <m>P(A|B)=\frac{5}{8}=0.625</m>.  These are not the same (being a student athelete seems to improve the odds that you are a biology major) so these are not independent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally note that <m>P(A)=\frac{12}{25}=0.48, P(B)=\frac{8}{25}=0.32, P(A\cap B)=\frac{5}{25}=0.2</m> but <m>P(A)P(B)=0.48\cdot 0.32=0.1536\neq 0.2=P(A\cap B)</m>.  So these are not independent.

  <p>
    There are several approaches. You only need to go through one of these to obtain answer.  Also recall that 4 people ordered both a burger and a hotdog.</p>

  </p>

  <p>
    Next note that <m>P(H)=\frac{6}{20}=0.3</m> and <m>P(H|B)=\frac{4}{18}=0.22222</m>.  These are not the same (ordering a hamburger makes it less likelt you also got a hotdog) so these are not independent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally note that <m>P(B)=\frac{18}{20}=0.9, P(H)=\frac{6}{20}=0.3, P(B\cap H)=\frac{4}{20}=0.2</m> but <m>P(B)P(H)=0.9\cdot 0.3=0.27\neq 0.2=P(B\cap H)</m>.  So these are not independent.

    There are several approaches. You only need to go through one of these to obtain answer.  Let <m>M</m> denote being a Math major and <m>A</m> denote getting an A.</p>

    <p> First note that <m>P(M)=0.1</m> and <m>P(M|A)=\frac{0.03}{0.3}=0.1</m>.  These are  the same (your chances of being a Math major is unaffected by whether you got an A) so these are  independent.
  </p>

  <p> Next note that <m>P(A)=0.3</m> and <m>P(A|M)=\frac{0.03}{0.1}=0.3</m>.  These are  the same (your chances of getting an A is unaffected by whether you were a Math major) so these are  independent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally note that <m>P(M)=0.1, P(A)=0.3, P(M\cap A)=0.03</m> so <m>P(M)P(A)=0.1\cdot 0.3=0.03P(M\cap A)</m>.  So these are  independent.

  Let's suppose that 20% of a town were zombified, and half the town were women.  If zombification and gender are independent, what percentage of the town are women who are not zombies?  What about neither zombies nor women?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    Let <m>Z</m> denote <q> is a zombie</q>and <m>W</m> denote is a woman.  Then we are given <m>P(Z)=0.2, P(W)=0.5</m>.  Since we are given that <m>P(Z\cap W)=P(Z)P(W)=0.2\cdot0.5=0.1</m> we have:

      </figure>
      Thus the proportion of the town who are women and not zombies is <m>P(Z^c\cap W)=0.4</m>.  Similarly, the proportion of the town who is neither women nor zombies is <m>P(Z^c\cap W^c)=0.4</m>.
