    <title>Turning Counting into Probability </title>
  <p>
    Recall  <xref ref="DefinitionProb"/>.   We are now equipped to find the cardinality of both <m>A</m>and <m>S</m>.  

  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider a 52 card deck, and draw 5 cards without replacement.
        <ol>
          <li> What is the probability that all 5 cards are spades?</li>
          <li> What is probability that all 5 cards are the same suit?</li>
          <li> What is the probability that are exactly two heart?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
      Recall that there are <m>C(52,5)</m> ways to select 5 cards of 52.  Thus <m>|S|=C(52,5)=2598960</m>.
       <ol>
          <li> There are 13 spades so the number of ways to select 5 spades is <m>C(13,5)=1287</m>.  Thus the probability of selecting 5 cards and getting all spades is <m>\frac{C(13,5)}{C(52,5)}=\frac{1287}{2598960}\approx 0.00495</m>.</li>
          <li> The number of ways to select all cards from the same suit is still <m>C(13,5)</m> but since there are 4 suits, the probability of selecting 5 cards and they are all the same suit is <m>\frac{4\cdot C(13,5)}{C(52,5)}=\frac{4\cdot 1287}{2598960}\approx 0.0198107</m>.</li>
          <li> We select 2 out of 13 hearts and 3 out of 39 non-hearts, and there are <m>C(13,2)\cdot C(39,3)=78\cdot 9139=712842</m> ways to do this.  Thus the probability you pick 5 cards and exactly 2 are hearts is <m>\frac{C(13,2)\cdot C(39,3)}{C(52,5)}=\frac{712842}{259860}\approx  0.27428</m></li>
        </ol>

      <example xml:id="ExampleDigits">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider a 4 digit passcode consisting of digits 0 through 9.
        <ol>
          <li> What is the probability that a random passcode doesn't repeat digits?</li>
          <li> What is probability that a random passcode only uses even digits?</li>
          <li> What is the probability only uses even digits without repitition?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
      Recall that there are <m>10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10=10^4=1000</m> possible passcodes.  Thus <m>|S|=10000</m>.
       <ol>
          <li> There are <m>P(10,4)=10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7=5040</m> passcodes that don't repeat digits.  Thus the probability that a passcode doesn't repeat digits is <m>\frac{P(10,4)}{10^4}=\frac{5040}{10000}=0.504</m> .</li>
          <li> There are <m>5^4=625</m> passcodes that only use even digits.  Thus the probability that a passcode uses only even digits is <m>\frac{5^4}{10^4}=\frac{625}{10000}=0.0625</m> .</li>
          <li> There are <m>P(5,4)=5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2=120</m> passcodes that don't repeat digits and only use even digits.  Thus the probability that a passcode doesn't repeat digits and only uses even digits is <m>\frac{P(5,4)}{10^4}=\frac{120}{10000}=0.012</m> .</li>
        </ol>

  <title>Operations on Events and Counting</title>
  <p>
    We can also apply all the probability techniques from <xref ref="Chap_SetProb"/> to these situations.
  </p>  

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider a 52 card deck, and draw 5 cards without replacement.
        <ol>
          <li> What is the probability that is at least one diamond?</li>
          <li> What the cards are all back or all non-face cards (2-9)?</li>
          <li> If the cards are all black, what is the probability they are all non-face cards?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Consider:
        <ol>
          <li> If <m>D</m> is the event <q>at least one diamond</q>, then <m>D^c</m> means <q>no diamonds</q>.  <m>P(D^c)=\frac{C(39,5)}{C(52,5)}=\frac{575757}{2598960}\approx 0.2215336</m>, since there are 29 non diamonds to pick 5 from.  So <m>P(D)=1-P(D^c)=1-\frac{C(39,5)}{C(52,5)}\approx 0.7784664.</m></li>
          <li> Let <m>B</m> denote <q>all black cards</q>, and <m>N</m> denote <q>all non-face cards</q>.  Note <m>P(B)=\frac{C(26,5)}{C(52,5)}</m>, <m>P(N)=\frac{C(36,5)}{C(52,5)}</m>, and <m>P(B\cap N)=\frac{C(18,5)}{C(52,5)}</m>.  Thus <me>P(B\cup N)=P(B)+P(N)-P(B\cap N)=\frac{C(26,5)+C(36,5)-C(18,5)}{C(52,5)}=\frac{65780+376992-8568}{2598960}\approx 0.167068.</me></li>
          <li> This is <m>P(N|B)=\frac{P(N\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{C(18,5)/C(52,5)}{C(26,5)/C(52,5)}=\frac{C(18,5)}{C(26,5)}=\frac{8568}{65780}\approx 0.130252.</m></li>

   <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider a 4 digit passcode consisting of digits 0 through 9.
        <ol>
          <li> What is the probability that a random passcode doesn't repeat digits or the digits are all even?</li>
          <li> If the digits are all even, what's the probability that they don't repeat?</li>
          <li> Are digits repeating and digits being even independent?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
      Let <m>R</m> denote <q>digits don't repeat</q> and <m>E</m> denote <q>digits are all even.</q>:
       <ol>
          <li>  Recall <xref ref="ExampleDigits"/>, we say <m>P(R)=\frac{P(10,4)}{10^4}, P(E)=\frac{5^4}{10^4}, P(R\cap E)=\frac{P(5,4)}{10^4}</m>.  Thus <me> P(R\cup E)= P(R)+P(E)-P(R\cap E)=\frac{P(10,4)+5^4-P(5,4)}{10^4}=\frac{5040+625-120}{10^4}=\frac{5545}{10000}=0.5545.</me></li>
          <li> Note that <m>P(R|E)=\frac{P(5,4)/10^4}{5^4/10^4}=\frac{P(5,4)}{5^4}=\frac{120}{625}=0.192</m> .</li>
          <li> Since <m>P(R|E)=0.192\neq0.504=P(R)</m> so these are not independent.</li>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose you had a bus of 20 people, and 5 are sick, suppose  3 were picked  to test at random.
            <ol>
            <li>What is the probability that everyone who was tested were all sick?</li>  
            <li>What is the probability that none are sick?</li>
            <li>What is the probability that 2 of the tested individuals were sick?</li>
            <li>If at least one person tested sick, what is the probability that were all sick?</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are <m>C(20,3)=1140</m> ways to pick 3 people out of 20.
          <ol>
            <li>There are <m>C(5,3)=10</m> ways to pick only sick people, so the probability this happens is <me>\frac{C(5,3)}{C(20,3)}=\frac{10}{1140}\approx 0.0088.</me></li>  
            <li>There are <m>C(15,3)=455</m> ways to pick only healthy people, so the probability this happens is <me>\frac{C(15,3)}{C(20,3)}=\frac{455}{1140}\approx 0.3991.</me></li>  
            <li>There are <m>C(5,2)\cdot C(15,1)=10\cdot 15=150</m> ways to pick two sick and one healthy person, so the probability this happens is <me>\frac{C(5,2)\cdot C(15,1)}{C(20,3)}=\frac{10\cdot 15}{1140}\approx  0.1316.</me></li> 
            <li>The probability that at least one person tested sick is <m>1-\frac{C(15,3)}{C(20,3)}</m>.  Thus assuming this happens, the probability everyone tests sick is <me> \frac{C(5,3)/C(20,3)}{1-C(15,3)/C(20,3)}\approx \frac{0.0088}{0.6009}\approx 0.0146.</me></li>

     <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            An elevator has 5 passengers and stops at 8 floors. It is equally
likely that a person will get off at any one of the 8 floors. Find
the probability that at least 2 passengers leave at the same
floor.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are <m>8^5</m> ways the passangers could get off the elevator.  The probability that everyone gets off at <em>different</em> floors is <m>\frac{P(8,5)}{8^5}=\frac{6720}{32768}\approx0.2051</m>.  So the probability that this doesn't happen, that is, at least two get off at the same floor, is: <me>1-\frac{P(8,5)}{8^5}=1-\frac{6720}{32768}\approx0.7949.</me>

     <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            There are two jars, jar one has 5 white marbles and 6 black marbles. Jar 2 has 8 white marbles and 7 black marbles.  Suppose you pick a jar at random and pick two marbles at random from said jar.
            <ol>
              <li> What is the probability both marbles are white?</li>
              <li> If both marbles are white, what is the probability Jar 2 was chosen?</li>
             </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>W</m> denote <q>both marbles are white</q>, <m>J_1</m> denote <q>Jar one was chosen</q>.  Note that <m>P(J_1)=0.5</m>.

           <ol>
              <li> So by Bayes Theorem:
              <md>
              <mrow>P(W)\amp =P(W|J_1)P(J_1)+P(W|J_1^c)(1-P(J_1))</mrow> 
              <mrow>P(W)\amp =\frac{C(5,2)}{C(11,2)}(0.5)+\frac{C(8,2)}{C(15,2)}(0.5)</mrow> 
              <mrow>P(W)\amp =\frac{10}{55}(0.5)+\frac{28}{105}(0.5)</mrow> 
              <mrow>P(W)\amp =\frac{36}{165}\approx 0.224242</mrow> 
            </md>

              </li>
              <li> Note, we assume <m>W</m>, so this is <m>P(J_2|W)</m>. This is then computed: <me>P(J_2^c|W)=\frac{P(J_2\cap W)}{P(W)}=\frac{P(W|J_1^c)(1-P(J_1))}{P(W)}=\frac{\frac{28}{105}(0.5)}{\frac{36}{165}}=\frac{11}{18}\approx 0.6111111.</me>  After all, white marbles are more likely in Jar 2, so an all white selection is more likely to come from Jar 2.</li>
