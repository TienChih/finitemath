      <p>
        We discuss a specific type of probability distribution.  If you had repeated random independent trials, how can we compute the distribution of succecess?
      </p>

    <title>A Motivating Example </title>
  
    <p>Suppose that a student has to take 4 exams in an English class, and that the probability that she receives an A on each exam is 30%.  Suppose also that the grades of each exam are independent of each other.  What is the probability that she receives an A on the first two exams and not the others?</p>


<p> Well, since the probability of getting an A on any exam is a 30%, and the Exam scores are independent of each other, she has a (.3)(.3) chance of getting A's on the first two.  Then she doesn't get an A on the second two, which has a 0.7 chance each of happening, so the chance of this event ocurring is: <me>(0.3)(0.3)(0.7)(0.7)=(0.3)^2(0.7)^2=0.0441.</me></p>



<p>
 <em> What is the probability the same student receives an A on exactly two exams?</em>
</p>

<p>The first thing we should ask ourselves is, how is this different from the previous problem?  In the previous problem, we required that the first 2 exams had to receive A's.  In this problem, ANY 2 exams can be an A, the first two, the last two, the second and third, whichever way we want.  In fact the total number of ways she could get two A's is:

<me>AANN, ANAN, ANNA, NAAN, NANA, NNAA</me>

where <m>N</m> stands for <q>not an A</q>.  How are we sure this is all the possible ways?  Well, we are basically asking to pick 2 out of 4  exams to be A's, and the number of ways to pick 2 out of 4 things is:

<me> C(4,2)=\frac{4!}{2!2!}=\frac{24}{4}=6.</me> </p>

<p>
Then, what is the probability that each of these A/Not A arrangements occur?  Well, for <m>ANAN</m> it would be <m>(0.3)(0.7)(0.3)(0.7)=(0.3)^2(0.7)^2</m>, for <m>NAAN</m> it would be <m>(0.3)(0.7)(0.7)(0.3)=(0.3)^2(0.7)^2</m>.  In fact, each of these grade arrangements have 2 A'S and 2 not A's, and so their probability of occurring would be <m>(0.3)^2(0.7)^2</m>.  Thus the probability of 
getting an A on two exams (any two) is: <me>C(4,2)\cdot (0.3)^2(0.7)^2=6\cdot 0.0441=0.2646</me>


Which is cool and all,  but at the end of the day, we want a <em>general</em> method of computing probabilities of this sort.</p>

<subsection>
  <title>General Binomial Probability</title>
  <p>
    <em>
      <q>
        Suppose that a student has to take <m>n</m> exams, and that the probability that she receives an A on each exam is <m>p</m>.  Suppose also that the grades of each exam are independent of each other.  What is the probability that she receives exactly <m>k</m> A's?
      </q>
      </em>
  </p>
  
<p>
  So we now arrive at the interesting version of this problem, but it's fundamentally not different from the above version.  So let's see:

<ul>
<li> There are <m>C(n,k)</m> ways one could select <m>k</m> out of the <m>n</m> exams to receive an A.</li>
<li>Given any of those, the chance she gets A's on those <m>k</m> exams is <m>p</m> per exam, so to get A's on all of them has prob <m>p^k</m>.</li>
<li> Then for the remaining <m>n-k</m> exams, each has a <m>1-p</m> chance of not getting an A.  So the chance that those exams don't receive an A is <m>(1-p)^{n-k}</m>.</li>
</ul>



Putting these together, the probability that she receives those $k$ A's is: <me>C(n,k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k}.</me>

Of course, this all extends beyond exam grades and A's.        
</p>

<definition xml:id="DefinitionBinomial">
  <p>
    Given <m>n</m> <em>independent</em> trials, each of which has <m>p</m> probability of success, let <m>X</m> denote the number of successes attained.  We call <m>X</m> a <term>binomial random variable</term>.  The probability that <m>k</m> successes are attained is: <me>P(X=k)=C(n,k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k}.</me>
  </p>
</definition>    

<p>  We can see this below:
  <interactive desmos="prwuifxwld"/>

  So we now can see the entire distribution.  The student above has a <m>0.2646</m> chance of getting two A's, a <m>0.0756</m> chance of gettine three A's, a <m>0.4116</m> chance of one A etcetera.</p>


<example xml:id="ExampleSoccer">
  <title>Penalty Shots</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
  Suppose a soccer player has a 70% chance of making a penalty shot.  She shoots 5 times.  Assume the results of the shots are independent.
  <ol>
    <li>What is the probability she makes 3 shots?</li>
    <li>What is the probability she makes at least 4 shots?</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
  <p>
  We note <m>n=5, p=0.7</m>, let <m>X</m> denote the number of succesful shots. 
  <ol>
    <li>This is <m>P(X=3)=C(5,3)(0.7)^3(0.3)^2=0.3087</m></li>
    <li>At least 4 means 4 or 5.  So this is <me>P(X=4)+P(X=5)=C(5,4)(0.7)^4(0.3)^1+C(5,5)(0.7)^5(0.3)^0=0.3602+0.1681=0.5283.</me></li>

  A factory has 10 machines, each of which has a 10% chance of malfunctioning in a day.

    <li>What is the probability exactly 2 malfunction?</li>
    <li>What is the probability at least one machine malfunctions?</li>

  <solution>
  <p>
  We note <m>n=10, p=0.1</m>, let <m>X</m> denote the number of malfunctioning machines.

    <li>This is <m>P(X=2)=C(10,2)(0.1)^2(0.9)^8=0.1937</m></li>
    <li>At least 1 means 1 though 10.  So one could sum up <m>P(X=1)+P(X=2)+\cdots P(X=10)</m>.  But this is also every possibility but <m>P(X=0)</m>.  So we could do <me>1-P(X=0)=1-C(10,0)(0.1)^0(0.9)^{10}=1-0.3487=0.6513.</me> </li>

  <title>Expectation, Variance and Standard Deviation for Binomial Probabilities</title>

<p>
  Given a binomial distribution, we could certainly compute expectation and variance the same way we did in <xref ref="Sec_ProbabilityDistributions"/>.  But, since the whole distribution is totally determined by <m>n, p</m>, shouldn't the expectation and variance be determined by these as well?</p>

  <p>For our above English test taking student, if she has a 30% chance of getting an A, wouldn't we <em>expect</em> that 30% of her tests turn out to be A's?  If someone had a 90% free-throw percentage and they shot 20 times, wouldn't we <em>expect</em> <m>0.9(20)=18</m> shots to make it?  There's a similar way of viewing variance which is beyond the scope of this text, but we can still see that both are totally determined by <m>n</m> and <m>p</m>.</p>


  <remark>
    <p>
      Given a <em>binomial random variable</em> with <m>n</m> trials and probability of success <m>p</m> per trial, we have:

      <ul>
        <li> <m>E(X)=np.</m>.  The number of trials, and the proportion who succeed.</li>
        <li> <m>Var(X)=np(1-p)</m></li>
        <li> <m>\sigma_X=\sqrt{Var(X)}=\sqrt{np(1-p)}</m></li>
      </ul>
      We reiterate these are for <em>BINOMIAL PROBABILITIES ONLY</em>.
    </p>
 </remark>     

<p>
  So for <m>n=4, p=0.3</m> we would have:

  <ul>
        <li> <m>E(X)=np=(4)(0.3)=1.2.</m>.  </li>
        <li> <m>Var(X)=4(0.3)(0.7)=0.84</m></li>
        <li> <m>\sigma_X=\sqrt{Var(X)}=\sqrt{0.84}\approx 0.9165</m></li>
      </ul>
Which we may verify:
 <interactive desmos="prwuifxwld"/>

We can also compute these values the old fashioned way:

        <li><m>Var(X)=np(1-p)=5(0.7)(0.3)=1.05</m>.</li>
        <li><m>\sigma_X=\sqrt{Var(X)}=\sqrt{1.05}\approx 1.0247.</m>

        <li>This is the sum of one through eight policies paying out, but its also just removing the case where no policies paid out.  So <me>1-P(X=0)=1-C(8,0)(0.25)^0(0.75)^8\approx 1-0.1001=0.8999.</me></li>
