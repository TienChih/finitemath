  <title>Systems of Linear Inequalities</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
    If a solution to a system of equations is a set of points that make several equations true,
    then the same is true of systems of linear inequalities.
    It's just going to be the collection of points that make all the inequalities true.
  </p>
</introduction>
  <p>
    So if say we had the system of linear inequalities:
    <md>
          <mrow>x+y\amp \geq 4</mrow>
          <mrow>x-2y\amp \leq 3</mrow>
    </md>
    We could ask ourselves if <m> (0,0), (4,4), (6,0), (2,-2)</m> belong to the region.
    <ol>
        <li> For <m>(0,0)</m>  note that:
        <md>
          <mrow>0+0\amp \not\geq 4</mrow>
          <mrow>0-2(0)\amp \leq 3</mrow>
        </md>
        So we satisfy the second but not the first inequality, so <m>(0,0)</m> does <em>not</em> belong to the region.
         </li>
        <li> For <m>(4,4)</m>  note that:
        <md>
          <mrow>4+4\amp \geq 4</mrow>
          <mrow>4-2(4)\amp \leq 3</mrow>
        </md>
        So we satisfy both inequalities, and <m>(4,4)</m>  <em>does</em> belong to the region!
         </li>
        <li> For <m>(6,0)</m>  note that:
        <md>
          <mrow>6+0\amp \geq 4</mrow>
          <mrow>6-2(0)\amp \not\leq 3</mrow>
        </md>
        So we satisfy the first inequality but not the second, so <m>(6,0)</m> does <em>not</em> belong to the region.
         </li>
         <li> For <m>(2,-2)</m>  note that:
        <md>
          <mrow>2+(-2)\amp \not\geq 4</mrow>
          <mrow>2-2(-2)\amp \not\leq 3</mrow>
        </md>
        So we satisfy neither inequality but not the second, and <m>(2,-2)</m> does <em>not</em> belong to the region.
         </li>
      </ol>
      We can use the Desmos graph and drag the point <m>(a,b)</m> around to verify which region satisfies both inequalities.
      <interactive desmos="is7lwibg4t"  />

  <example xml:id="Example_SysLinearInequality">
    <statement>
      <p>
        What are the solutions to the following system:
        <md>
          <mrow>2x+3y\amp \leq 12</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp \geq 0</mrow>
          <mrow>y\amp \geq 0</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        We know from earlier that the solutions have to lie in the bottom right hand of the plane on or below the line <m>2x+3y=12</m>.
        We also know that neither the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> values can be negative.
        What's left is a sort of triangle:
        <interactive desmos="2dekmagipa"  />
        This is the overlap of regions where all 3 inequalities are true.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easier to see this region by nesting the inequalities as follows:
        <interactive desmos="apmcey4kfa"  />
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Use Desmos to graph the following system of inequalities:
      <md>
          <mrow>3x-5y\amp \leq 8</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp \geq 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x+y\amp \leq 10</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>  
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      By nesting the inequalities, we obtain the following Desmos graph:
