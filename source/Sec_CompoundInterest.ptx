  <title>Compound Interest</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Almost no meaningful financial transaction in the world is computed by simple interest.
      The most common type of interest is compound interest which charges interest not just on your principle loan,
      but also on previously accrued interest as well.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>A first look at compound interest</title>
    <p>
      So lets say you took out $100 in a loan that charged 5% monthly interest compounded monthly.
      That means each month,
      you would owe 5% more than what you owed the month before.
      <me>
        \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{ Month }  \amp  \text{ Debt } \\ \hline 0 \amp  100\\ 1\amp  100+(.05)(100)=100+5=105\\ 2\amp  105+(.05)(105)=105+5.25=110.25\\ 3 \amp  110.25+(.05)(110.25)=110.25+5.5125=115.7625\\ \vdots \amp  \vdots\\ \hline \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So not only is the debt increasing,
      but the amount that the debt increases per month, also increases.
      Is there an easy way to see how much we'd owe in say 10 months without computing every month in between?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, If I owe <m>X</m> dollars in any given month,
      then the next month I'll owe <m>X+0.05X=(1.05)X</m> dollars.
      In another month I'll owe <m>1.05X+(.05)(1.05)X=(1.05)(1.05)X=X(1.05)^2</m> dollars.
      If we apply this logic to our situation, we can see:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{ Month }  \amp  \text{ Debt } \\ \hline 0 \amp  100\\ 1\amp  100+(.05)(100)=(1.05)100\\ 2\amp  (1.05)100+(.05)((1.05)100)=(1.05)(1.05)100=(1.05)^2 100\\ 3 \amp  (1.05)^2100+(.05)((1.05)^2100)=(1.05)(1.05)^2 100=(1.05)^3 100\\ \vdots \amp  \vdots\\ n \amp  (1.05)^n100\\ \hline \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So in 10 months,
      we'd owe <m>100\cdot (1.05)^{10}\approx \$162.89</m>.
      In general, this forms an <term>exponential function</term>:
      <interactive desmos="r51afj5zwr"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, if the interest rate per time unit is <m>i</m>,
      then after <m>n</m> time units:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{ Time Unit }  \amp  \text{ Debt } \\ \hline 0 \amp  P\\ 1\amp  P+iP=(1+i)P\\ 2\amp  (1+i)P+i(1+i)P=(1+i)^2P\\ 3 \amp  (1+i)^2P+i(1+i)^2P=(1+i)^3P\\ \vdots \amp  \vdots\\ n \amp  (1+i)^nP\\ \hline \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      <interactive desmos="kqz7bwj8ip"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have the general equation
      <md>
        <mrow>A\amp =P(1+i)^n,</mrow>
        <mrow>I\amp =P(1+i)^n-P.</mrow>
      </md>
      Where <m>A</m> is the accumulated value, <m>P</m> is the value of the principle, <m>i</m> is the interest rate, <m>n</m> is the number of time units, and <m>I</m> is the total value of the interest.</p>

      <p> But looking at <m> A =P(1+i)^n</m>, if one  knew any 3 of these values,
      in principle one should be able to find the 4th.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that I make an investment $500 at 8% annual interest.
          How much will this investment be worth in 10 years?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we note that:
          <md>
            <mrow>P\amp = 500</mrow>
            <mrow>i\amp = 0.08</mrow>
            <mrow>n\amp = 10</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are solving:
          <me>
            A=500(1+.08)^{10}\approx 10794.62.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <interactive desmos="dmodfltuzf"  />

      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that I take out a loan at 4% a year, and after 5 years, I owe <m>\$7,000</m>.
          How much was the initial loan?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we note that:

            <mrow>A\amp = 7000</mrow>
            <mrow>i\amp = 0.04</mrow>
            <mrow>n\amp = 5</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are solving:

            <mrow>7000\amp =P(1+.04)^{5}</mrow>
            <mrow>P\amp =\frac{7000}{(1.04)^5}\approx 5753.49.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the initial value of the loan is of <m>\$5753.49</m>.
        </p>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we note that:

            <mrow>i\amp \approx 0.018829</mrow>

    <title>AN ISSUE OF EXTREME ANNOYANCE</title>
    <p>
      In the above examples, we work with interest rates described in terms of the time units in which they are discussed.
      However, financial companies have devised a concept that obfuscates this principle via an artificial notion of
      <q>compounding periods</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you have a debt of $100 that accrues 10% annual interest.
      With no other given information,
      we would say that the amount you owe in <m>10</m> years would be
      <me>
        A=100(1.1)^{10}\approx \$259.37
      </me>
      right?
      But what a financial institution will do is say that the debt is
      <q>compounded quarterly</q>
      i.e. 4 times a year.
      Thus instead of 10% interest per year,
      it will now be <m>10\%/4=2.5\%</m> interest
      <term> per quarter</term>.
      How much will you owe in 10 years?
      Well, 10 years is 40 quarters so:
      <me>
        A=100(1.025)^{40}\approx 268.51
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, if the compounding is done <em> monthly</em>,
      then this is 12 times a year,
      and each month you'd be charged at a rate of <m>\frac{10\%}{12}</m>.
      So in 10 years or 120 months, you would owe:
      <me>
        A=100\left(1+\frac{0.1}{12}\right)^{120}\approx 270.70
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      My belief is this accomplishes 2 things:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            By making the issue more complicated,
            it makes it more difficult for consumers to figure out how much they are actually going to be charged in interest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            By increasing compounding periods,
            you can effectively charge more interest,
            see how much the debt's grow in the above scenarios?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In general if you are charged an annual interest rate of <m>r</m> compounded <m>m</m> times a year for <m>t</m> years.
      You are really getting charged
      <me>
        i=\frac{r}{m}
      </me>
      interest rate per time unit, and the number of time units will be
      <me>
        n=mt
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much yearly interest is there really?
      It's how much interest you end up accruing in a year: Let <m>r_E</m> be the effective annual interest:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(1+r_E)\amp = P(1+r/m)^{m}</mrow>
        <mrow>1+r_E\amp = (1+r/m)^{m}</mrow>
        <mrow>r_E\amp = (1+r/m)^{m}-1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So 10% interest compounded quarterly is effectively:
      <me>
        r_E=(1+0.1/4)^4-1\approx0.1038
      </me>
      or 10.38% annual interest.
      Whereas 10% compounded monthly is
      <me>
        r_E=(1+0.1/12)^{12}-1\approx 0.1047
      </me>
      or 10.47% annual interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This artifical interest rate is often referred to as <term>APR</term> or <em>Annual Percentage Rate</em>.  
    </p>  
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that I take out a loan for $500 at 12% annual interest charged biannually.
          How much will I owe in 10 years?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we note that:
          <md>
            <mrow>P\amp = 500\ \text{ the initial loan }</mrow>
            <mrow>i\amp = 0.12/2=0.06 \ \text{ the interest rate per half-year }</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are solving:
          <me>
            A=500(1+.06)^{20}\approx 1603.57
          </me>.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>

          (Since interest is compounded annually, 0.08 is the actual annual interest rate.)
