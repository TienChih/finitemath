  <title>Arguments</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we discuss logical arguments.  The point of logic, is to take certain facts or statements known to be true, and from that draw certain conclusions.  We will use what we've learned about logic to describe some valid argument types.  We will then put these argument types together to deduce what is and isn't a valid or appropriate argument.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Argument types</title>
    <p>The first type of argument is <term>Modus Ponens</term>, it is based on the <em>implication</em> <m>p\to q</m>.  If you know that whenever <m>p</m> is true, then we can deduce <m>q</m> is true.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{l}
      p\to q \\
      p\\
      \hline
      q
      \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
    <p>
      So say
      <q>If your pet is a pitbull, then it is a dog</q>.
      <q>Your pet is a pitbull</q>.
      It would then be fair to conclude
      <q>Therefore your pet is a dog</q>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Arguments employing Modus Ponenes</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      The following are also examples of Modus Ponones:
      <ol>
        <li>"If we drive faster, we will make it in time.  We drove faster.  Thus we made it in time."</li>
        <li>"If I get sick, I will stay home.  I got sick.  Therefore I stayed home."</li>
        <li>"If <m>x</m> is even, then <m>x^2</m> is even.  <m>x</m> is even, thus <m>x^2</m> is even."</li>
        <li>"If <m>S</m> is a square, then <m>S</m> is a rectangle.  <m>S</m> is a square, thus <m>S</m> is a rectangle."</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>
  </statement>
    </example>  
    <p>
    The next argument type is <term>Modus Tollens</term>.  This is analagous to the <em>contrapositive</em>. So if you're given that <m>p\to q</m>, and you know that <m>q</m> isn't true, that is <m>\sim q</m>, then it follows that <m>p</m> isn't true, or <m>\sim p</m>.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{l}
      p\to q \\
      \sim q\\
      \hline
      \sim p
      \end{array}
    </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So suppose the following were true:
      <q>If your eat peanuts, then you will have an allergic reaction</q> and
      <q>You do not have an allergic reaction</q>.
      It would then be fair to conclude
      <q>Therefore you did not eat peanuts</q>.
    </p>
     <example>
      <title>Arguments employing Modus Tollens</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      The following are also examples of Modus Tollens:
      <ol>
        <li>"If I eat lunch, I won't be hungry.  I'm hungry.  Thus I must not have eaten lunch."</li>
        <li>"If we stay behind the line, no one will get hurt.  Someone got hurt.  We must not have stayed behind the line."</li>
        <li>"If <m>x</m> is even, then <m>x^2</m> is even.  <m>x^2</m> is odd, thus <m>x</m> is odd."</li>
        <li>"If <m>S</m> is a square, then <m>S</m> is a rectangle.  <m>S</m> is a not a rectangle, thus <m>S</m> must not be a square."</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>
  </statement>
    </example>  
    <p>
    The next arugment type is <term>Disjunctive Syllogism </term>.  This is based on   <em> or</em>.  If you're given that either <m>p</m> or <m>q</m> is true, that is <m>p\vee q </m>, and then one of them is false (<m>\sim p</m> or <m>\sim q</m>) , then it follows that the other must be true  (<m>q</m> or <m>p</m>).
    <me>
      \begin{array}{l}
      p\vee q \\
      \sim q\\
      \hline
      p
      \end{array}
    </me>
    <me>
      \begin{array}{l}
      p\vee q \\
      \sim p\\
      \hline
      q
      \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
    <p>
      "I have to take either math or science next semester, I'm not going to take math,
      so therefore, I must take science."
    </p>
     <example>
      <title>Arguments employing Disjunctive Syllogism</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      The following are also examples of Disjunctive Syllogism:
      <ol>
        <li>"Either I or my spouse has the card.  I don't have it so my spouse must have it."</li>
        <li>"She can order the fish or the chicken.  She didn't order the chicken so she must have ordered the fish."</li>
        <li>"A linear function <m>\ell(x)</m> either has nonero slope or is constant.  It's not constant so <m>\ell(x)</m> must have nonzero slope."</li>
        <li>"An integer greater than 1 <m>n</m> is either prime or composite.  Since <m>n</m> isn't prime, it must be composite."</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>
  </statement>
    </example>  
    <p>
      The final type of argument is <term >Reasoning by Transitivity</term>.  It connects two implications together.  If you have <m>p\to q</m> and <m>q\to r</m>, then it must follow that <m>p\to r</m>.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{l}
      p\to q \\
      q\to r\\
      \hline
      p\to r
      \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
    <p>
      "If it rains then I will get wet.
      If I get wet, I will get sick." <m>\to</m>
      <q>Therefore, if it rains, then I will get sick.</q>
    </p>
     <example>
      <title>Arguments employing Transitivity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      The following are also examples of Reasoning by Transitivity:
      <ol>
        <li>"If we drive faster, we will make it in time.  If we make it in time, we can have lunch.  Thus if we drive faster, we can have lunch."</li>
        <li>"If I get sick, I will stay home.  If I stay home, I will work on my book.  So if I get sick, I will work on my book."</li>
        <li>"If it rains, I will have to move the clothes inside.  If I move the clothes inside, I will be late.  So if it rains, I will be late."</li>
        <li>"If <m>S</m> is a square, then <m>S</m> is a rectangle.  If <m>S</m> is a rectangle, all it's angles are right angles.  Thus if <m>S</m> is a square, then all of it's angles are right angles."</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>
  </statement>
    </example>

        <li>"If it snows, the children can go sledding, if the children go sledding the house will be quiet.  Thus if it snows then the house will be quiet."</li>

        <li>"If <m>x</m> is a multiple of 4, then <m>x</m> is not prime.  <m>x</m> is prime, thus <m>x</m> is not a multiple of four."</li>
        <li>"If a  function has a constant slope, then it is linear.  If a function is linear, then it is a polynomial.  Thus every function with positive slope is a polynomial."</li>

<title>Fallacies</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The following are common <term> Fallacies</term>.
      They seem like they could be legitimate arguments, and are often employed, but they are not.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <p>
    The first fallacy we discuss is the <term>Fallacy of the Converse</term>.  The Fallacy of the Converse takes an implication <m>p\to q</m> and then argues that if <m>q</m> is true than <m>p</m> must be true as well.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{l}
      p\to q \\
      q\\
      \hline
      p
      \end{array}
    </me>
    So for example "If I sell this TV, I will have $200.  I have $200, so I must have sold the TV."  The reason this is a fallacy is because, absent more information, you could have acquired $200 in any other way, it was never suggested that this is your only avenue to have acquired this money.  Recall that both <m>F\to T, T\to T</m> are true statements, so knowing that <m>q</m> is true, does not allow you to conclude automatically that <m>p</m> is true.
  </p>
  <example>
    <title>False arguments employing the Fallacy of Converse</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      The following are also examples of Fallacy of Converse:
      <ol>
        <li>"If I speed, I'll get pulled over.  I got pulled over, it must be for speeding."</li>
        <li>"If the crime stops, then there will be no reported cases.  We stopped reporting cases, so crime must have stopped."</li>
        <li>"If <m>S</m> is a square, then <m>S</m> is a rectangle.  <m>S</m> is a   rectangle, thus <m>S</m> must  be a square."</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>
  </statement>
    </example>  
  <p>
    The next fallacy is the <term>Fallacy of the Inverse</term>.  This supposes that you have an implication <m>p\to q</m> and then argues tht if <m>p</m> is false, than <m>q</m> must be false as well.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{l}
      p\to q \\
      \sim p\\
      \hline
      \sim q
      \end{array}
    </me>
      So for example "If I order pizza, then I will have lunch.  I didn't order pizza, I must not have had lunch." The reason this is a fallacy is because it is clear that you could potentially have had anything else for lunch.  Without more knowledge, it can't be concluded based on this alone that you had no lunch options.  Recall that <m>F\to q</m> is always true no matter what <m>q</m> is.  So if you didn't get pizza, could have had lunch?  Yes.  Could you not have had lunch?  Also yes.  You simply can't conclude anything.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>False arguments employing the Fallacy of Inverse</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      The following are also examples of Fallacy of the Inverse:
      <ol>
        <li>"If I am hungry, then I will eat lunch.  I'm not hungry, so I won't eat lunch."</li>
        <li>"If profits don't go up, people will get fired.  Profits did go up, so no one will get fired."</li>
        <li>"If <m>(x,y)</m> is an optimal solutin to a linear programming problem, then it is a corner point.  <m>(x,y)</m> is not an optimal solution, so it is not a corner point."</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>
  </statement>
    </example>

<exercise>
  <title>Valid or Fallacious arguments</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      Identify if the argument is valid, and the argument or fallacy type for each of the following:
      <ol>
        <li>"If there's an accident, traffic will be bad. Traffic wasn't bad, so there was no accident."</li>
        <li>"If someone eats rotten food, they will get sick. Someone got sick so they must have eaten rotten food."</li>
        <li>"If <m>x</m> is a multiple of 4, then it is not prime.  Since <m>x</m> is not a multiple of 4, then it must be prime."</li>
        <li>"If <m>\ell(x)</m> is a linear function, than it has a slope.  Since <m>\ell(x)</m> is a linear function, we can conclude it must have a slope."</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
        <p>
      The arugments are:
      <ol>
        <li>Modus Tollens</li>
        <li>Fallacy of Converse.</li>
        <li>Fallacy of Inverse.</li>
        <li> Modus Ponens.</li>

<subsection>
  <title>Valid Arguments</title>
  <p>  Here, we will use our examples and fallacies above to construct examples of arguments, both valid and invalid.</p>

      <p>
        Consider the following: If I fill the lawnmower with gas, and change the oil, it will start.
        I didn't start and I filled us the gas.
        Therefore I didn't change the oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>g=</m>
              <q>fill the lawnmmower with gas.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>o=</m>
              <q>change the oil.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>s=</m>
              <q>lawnmower starts.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        So what we know is <m>(g\wedge o)\to s, g \sim s</m>.
        So:
        <me>
          \begin{array}{lcl} (g\wedge o)\to s\amp \ \ \ \amp \\ \sim s\\ \hline \sim(g\wedge o)=\sim g \vee\sim o \amp  \amp \text{ Modus Tollens } \\ \\ \sim g \vee \sim o \\ g=\sim (\sim g)\\ \hline \sim o  \amp  \amp \text{ Disjunctive Syllogism } \end{array}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore <m>\sim o</m>: "I did not change the oil".
        This was a valid argument.
      </p>
    
      <p>Next we give an example of a flawed argument.</p>
      <p>
        Consider the following: If I drink coffee, I will be happy.
        If I drink coffee, I will be wired.
        If I am happy, then I am wired.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>c=</m>
              <q>drink coffee.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>h=</m>
              <q>be happy.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>w=</m>
              <q>be wired.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        What we have is <m>c\to h, c\to w</m>.
        But there's nothing here to connect <m>h</m> to <m>w</m>.
        If we knew this person drank coffee,
        we could make that conclusion,
        but since we don't know that,
        if we knew that they were happy,
        it could be for some reason other than drinking coffee.
        So we have no idea whether or not they'd be wired as well.
        So we cannot conclude <m>h \to w</m> and this is NOT a valid argument.
      </p>

      <exercise>
        <title>Constructing an argument</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      Suppose you knew the following:</p><p> If <m>A, B</m> are the same point, then the distance between them is zero.  If <m>A, B</m> are different points, there is exactly one line containing both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  There is not exactly one line containing both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.</p>
      <p>Construct a valid argument to show the distance betweem <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is zero.
      
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
        <p>
      Let's define the following:
      <ul>
        <li><m>s=</m>"<m>A, B</m> are the same point."</li>
        <li><m>z=</m>"The distance between <m>A, B</m> is zero."</li>
        <li><m>\ell=</m>"There is exactly one line cointaining both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>."</li>

      </ul>  
      Then what we are given is:
      <ul>
        <li><m>s\to z</m></li>
        <li><m>\sim s \to \ell</m></li>
        <li><m>\sim\ell</m></li>

      </ul>  
      Thus we can proceed as follows:

      <me>
          \begin{array}{lcl} 
          \sim s\to \ell\amp \ \ \ \amp \\ 
          \sim \ell
          \\ \hline 
          \sim (\sim s)=s \amp  \amp \text{ Modus Tollens } \\ \\ 
          s\to z \\ 
          s\\ 
          \hline 
          z  \amp  \amp \text{ Modus Ponnens } \end{array}
        </me>
        Thus concluding <m>z=</m>"The distance between <m>A, B</m> is zero."

    </p>
  </solution>
    </exercise> 

    

    <exercise>
      <title>Construction an argument 2</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      Suppose you knew the following:</p>

      <p> If Frida has breakfast, she will have either pancakes or waffles.  Frida had breakfast and did not have waffles.  </p>

      <p>Construct a valid argument to show Frida had pancakes.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
        <p>
      Let's define the following:
      <ul>
        <li><m>b=</m>"Frida had breakfast."</li>
        <li><m>p=</m>"Frida had pancakes."</li>
        <li><m>w=</m>"Frida had waffles."</li>

      </ul>  
      Then what we are given is:
      <ul>
        <li><m>b\to (p\vee w)</m></li>
        <li><m>b</m></li>
        <li><m>\sim w</m></li>

      </ul>  
      Thus we can proceed as follows:

      <me>
          \begin{array}{lcl} 
          b\to (p\vee w)\amp \ \ \ \amp \\ 
          b
          \\ \hline 
          p\vee w \amp  \amp \text{ Modus Ponnens } \\ \\ 
          p\vee w \\ 
          \sim w\\ 
          \hline 
          p  \amp  \amp \text{ Disjunctive Syllogism } \end{array}
        </me>
        Thus concluding <m>p=</m>"Frida had pancakes."

    </p>
  </solution>

        <li><m>e=</m>"<m>x</m> is a multiple of two."</li>

      </ul>  
      Then what we are given is:
      <ul>
        <li><m>f\wedge e\to t</m></li>
        <li><m>\sim t</m></li>
        <li><m>\sim e</m></li>

      </ul>  
      So one hypothetically start with Modus Tollens:

      <me>
          \begin{array}{lcl} 
          (f\wedge e)\to t\amp \ \ \ \amp \\ 
          \sim t
          \\ \hline 
          \sim(f\wedge e)=\sim f \vee\sim e\amp  \amp \text{ Modus Tollens }  \end{array}
        </me>

        Next we are given <m>\sim e</m>.  But from this we <em>cannot</em> use Disjunctive Syllogism to conclude <m>\sim (\sim f)=f</m>.  Notice that in an or statement, both statements can be true.  So if <m>x</m> isn't a multiple of two, it doesn't have to be a multiple of five. 7 is neither a multiple of 2, 5 nor 10.

      <title>Identify the flaw 2</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
      Find the flaw in the following line of reasoning:</p>

      <p> If it  snows, the city will send out snow plows.  If the city sends out snow plows, traffic will get bad.  Traffic got bad, so therefore it snowed. </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
        <p>
      Let's define the following:
      <ul>
        <li><m>s=</m>"It snows."</li>
        <li><m>p=</m>"The city sends out snow plows."</li>
        <li><m>t=</m>"Traffic got bad."</li>

      </ul>  
      Then what we are given is:
      <ul>
        <li><m>s\to p</m></li>
        <li><m>p\to t</m></li>
        <li><m>t</m></li>

      </ul>  
      So one hypothetically start with Reasoning by Transitivity:

      <me>
          \begin{array}{lcl} 
          s\to p\amp \ \ \ \amp \\ 
          p\to t
          \\ \hline 
          s\to t\amp  \amp \text{ Reasnoning by Transitivity }  \end{array}
        </me>

        Next we are given <m>t</m>.  But we cannot from <m>t</m> conclude <m>s</m>.  This would be the Fallacy of the Converse.  There's all sorts of reasons traffic might be bad, it may have nothing to do with snows or snow plows.
