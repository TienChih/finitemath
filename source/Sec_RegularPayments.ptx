  <title>Regular Payments</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
    Up until this point, we have discussed one time loans or investments.  But the fact is that most loans and investments aren't made or paid off in single lump sums.  You may purchase a car or a vehicle, and then slowly pay off that debt over time.  Maybe you're lucky enough to recieve an inheritance in an account that you slowly draw money from until it is depleted.  Maybe you make regular payments into a retirement or rainy day fund until a certain date or time is reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      This complicates the process of computing the present and future value of loans and investments.  If you make regular payments into an account, then each payment will accrue interest, but for different lengths of time.  Similarly, if you have an account earning interest you draw from regularly, then the account is still generating interest, but less and less as you draw the funds out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we will address these issues.

    <title>Future Value</title>
    <p>
      Let's say you have a bank account that gives you 2% monthly interest
      and let's also say that from January to May,
      you deposit $100 each month.
      How much will you have in May?
      Well:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 100 dollars you put in January would accrue interests for 4 months,
            so you'd have <m>100(1.02)^4</m> dollars.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 100 dollars you put in February would accrue interests for 3 months,
            so you'd have <m>100(1.02)^3</m> dollars.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 100 dollars you put in March would accrue interests for 2 months,
            so you'd have <m>100(1.02)^2</m> dollars.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 100 dollars you put in April would accrue interests for 1 months,
            so you'd have <m>100(1.02)^1</m> dollars.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The 100 dollars you put in May would accrue interests for 0 months,
            so you'd have <m>100(1.02)^0</m> dollars.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      So you'd have:
      <me>
        100(1.02)^4+100(1.02)^3+100(1.02)^2+100(1.02)^1+100(1.02)^0\approx \$520.40
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if this went on for 10 months?
      For 10 years?
      You probably wouldn't want to calculate every single one of these.
      So is there an easier way to compute something like
      <me>
        100(1.02)^4+100(1.02)^3+100(1.02)^2+100(1.02)^1+100(1.02)^0?
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have a sum of things that look like:
      <m>x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^1+x^0</m>.
      There is a funny fact about this sum. if we multiply it by <m>(x-1)</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp\  (x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^1+x^0)(x-1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = (x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^1+x^0)x-(x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^1+x^0)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = x^{n+1}+x^n+\cdots+x-x^n-x^{n-1}-\cdots-x^0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = x^{n+1}-x^0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = x^{n+1}-1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus:
      <md>
        <mrow>(x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+1)(x-1)\amp = x^{n+1}-1</mrow>
        <mrow>x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+1\amp = \frac{x^{n+1}-1}{x-1}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we should note that the future value of our investment above is:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp\  100(1.02)^4+100(1.02)^3+100(1.02)^2+100(1.02)^1+100(1.02)^0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 100((1.02)^4+(1.02)^3+(1.02)^2+(1.02)^1+(1.02)^0)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 100\frac{(1.02)^5-1}{1.02-1}</mrow>
        <mrow>S\amp = 100\frac{(1.02)^5-1}{.02}\approx \$520.40.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Where <m>S</m> is the future value.  In 5 months, you would have <m>\$520.40</m> in this account!</p>
      <p>
      Now, if we did this for <m>n</m> months instead of 5, we would obtain:
      <me>
        S=100\frac{(1.02)^n-1}{.02}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the monthly
      (or whichever time unit)
      interest rate was <m>i</m> instead of 2%, we would obtain:
      <me>
        S=100\frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      And if the payments were <m>\$R</m> instead of $100, we would finally have:
      <me>
        S=R\frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i}
      </me>
      To verify, see the Desmos calculator below, adjust <m>n, i</m> and <m>R</m> as needed:
      <interactive desmos="kccfq8z6vm"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      So here we have constructed the formula for the future value of a debt or investment based on a constant payment.
    </p>

      <title>Future Value</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that I deposit $100 into an account at 1% monthly interest compounded monthly.
          How much will be in the account in 5 years?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we have:

            <mrow>n\amp = 60</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are solving:

            <mrow>S\amp = 100\frac{(1.01)^{60}-1}{0.01}\approx8166.97</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So in 5 years, this account will be worth <m>\$8166.97</m>.

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we have:

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are solving:

            <mrow>8000\amp = 500\frac{(1+i)^{12}-1}{i}</mrow>
            <mrow>16\amp = \frac{(1+i)^{12}-1}{i}</mrow>
          </md>
          Then, rather than engage in a nightmarish algebraic exercise, we will simply plot <m>y=\frac{(1+x)^{12}-1}{x}</m> and see when it reaches the value <m>y=12</m>.
          <interactive desmos="gcisbmg5wi"  />
          We can observe that these curves intersect when <m>x\approx 0.0509</m>.
        </p>

          So each year, Olive's account would have to accrue <m>5.09\%</m> interest.

    <title>Present Value</title>
    <p>
      Just as a series of regular payments or withdrawals has a future value <m>S</m>, so to do they have a present value <m>P</m>.
      So if we have <m>n</m> payments of <m>R</m> at regular interest rate <m>i</m>,
      the future value is <m>S=R\frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i}</m>.
      What is it's present value <m>P</m>?
      To see this, recall that in   <xref ref="Sec_CompoundInterest" />, we have established the following relationship between present and future value:
      <md>
        <mrow>S\amp = P(1+i)^n</mrow>
        <mrow>P\amp = \frac{S}{(1+i)^n}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point, we may substitute <m>S=R\frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i}</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>P\amp = \frac{R\frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i}}{(1+i)^n}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = R\frac{((1+i)^n-1)\frac{1}{(1+i)^n}}{i}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = R\frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+i)^n}}{i}</mrow>
        <mrow>P\amp = R\frac{1-(1+i)^{-n}}{i}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that we invest $100,000 in an account that gives 1% monthly interest and I'd like to pull a regular sum of money out of the account for the next 10 years.
      What is the maximum that I could pull out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we have a present value of <m>P=100,000</m>,
      a monthly interest rate of <m>i=0.01</m> and <m>n=120</m> months.
      So:
      <md>
        <mrow>100000\amp = R\frac{1-(1.01)^{-120}}{.01}</mrow>
        <mrow>1000\amp \approx R(1-0.302995)</mrow>
        <mrow>R\amp \approx \frac{1000}{0.697005}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \approx 1434.71</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So with an investment like that,
      you could pull out <m>\$1434.71</m> a month for the next 10 years.

      <title>Interest Rate</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Jasmine lends <m>\$2500</m> to a friend who will make <m>\$200</m> weekly payments on it for 15 weeks.  What in effect is the weekly interest rate of her loan?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          So we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>R\amp = 200</mrow>
            <mrow>P\amp = 2500</mrow>
            <mrow>n\amp = 15</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are solving:
          <md>
            <mrow>2500\amp = 200\frac{1-(1+i)^{-15}}{i}</mrow>
            <mrow>12.5\amp = \frac{1-(1+i)^{-15}}{i}</mrow>
          </md>
        So by plotting <m>y=\frac{1-(1+x)^{-15}}{x}</m> and <m>y=12.5</m>, we can see what the value of <m>i</m> should be:
        <interactive desmos="hfebx0pt6m"  />
        <m>i\approx 0.0237</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the effective weekly interest she charged was <m>2.37\%</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <interactive desmos="ewvd9gpxnh"  />
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
