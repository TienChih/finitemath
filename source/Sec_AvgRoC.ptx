  <title>Average rates of change</title>

    <p>
      Linear functions have a coinstant rate of change, the slope.  But as we have seen, other functions can increase, or decrease, at varying rates. Can we, looking at an interval of time, determine the <em>average</em> rate of change of a function?

    <title>Average Rate of Change as a Slope</title>
  <p>
    Consider a rocket that is launched into the air and has height
    <m>f(x)=-5x^2+20x</m> meters in <m>x</m> seconds.
    <interactive desmos="ju4uz0bnhg" />
    How fast is the rocket traveling when it's launched (<m>x=0</m> seconds)?
  </p>
  <p>
    Turns out, it's not so easy to think about what this is.
    We don't typically consider velocities in terms of instantaneous action.
    Our methods of measuring velocity reflects this,
    units of velocity (or speed) take the form of  meters <term> per second</term>,
    miles <term> per hour</term>,
    in other words velocity is some change in distance <term> per time unit</term>
    and that unit of time is not typically zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what now?
    Lets start by asking an easier question,
    what is the average velocity of the rocket over the first 3 seconds?
  </p>
  <p>
    It's best in a scenario like this to <em>not</em> overthink the underlying problem.
    At 0 seconds,
    the rocket is <m>f(0)=-5(0)^2+20(0)=0</m> meters off the ground.
    After 3 seconds it is now <m>f(3)=-5(3^2)+20(3)=15</m> meters off the ground.
    So if the rocket  rose by 15 meters in 3 seconds?
    Your average velocity must be <em>5 meters per second</em>.

    The <term>  average rate of change </term> of a function <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is: <me>m=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</me>
    This is just the slope of the line connecting <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        In our rocket example above, where the height is <m>f(x)=-5x^2+20x</m> meters in <m>x</m> seconds, find the rate of change of the rocket over the following periods of time:
        <ul>
          <li> The interval <m>[0,2]</m>.</li>
          <li> The interval <m>[0,1]</m>.</li>
          <li> The interval <m>[0,0.5]</m>.</li>
          <li> The interval <m>[1,2]</m>.</li>
          <li> The interval <m>[1,1.25]</m>.</li>
          <li> The interval <m>[1,1+h]</m>.</li>
          <li> The interval <m>[a,a+h]</m>.</li>
         </ul>
         </p> 
     </statement>  
     <solution>
      <p>
        We can use either the Desmos calculator above, or algebra:
        <ul>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[0,2]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0}\amp = \frac{-5(2^2)+20(2)-(-5(0^2)+20(0))}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{20-0}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 10.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the height of the rocket between 0 and 2 seconds is 10 m/s.
        </li>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[0,1]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{f(1)-f(0)}{2-0}\amp = \frac{-5(1^2)+20(1)-(-5(0^2)+20(0))}{1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{15-0}{1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 15.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the height of the rocket between 0 and 1 seconds is 15 m/s.
        </li>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[0,0.5]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{f(0.5)-f(0)}{0.5-0}\amp = \frac{-5(0.5^2)+20(0.5)-(-5(0^2)+20(0))}{0.5}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{8.75-0}{0.5}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 17.5.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the height of the rocket between 0 and 0.5 seconds is 17.5 m/s.
        </li>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[0,2]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}\amp = \frac{-5(2^2)+20(2)-(-5(1^2)+20(1))}{1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{20-15}{1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 5.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the height of the rocket between 1 and 2 seconds is 5 m/s.
        </li>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[1,1.25]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{f(1.25)-f(1)}{1.25-1}\amp = \frac{-5(1.25^2)+20(1.25)-(-5(1^2)+20(1))}{0.25}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{17.1875-15}{0.25}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 8.75.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the height of the rocket between 1 and 1.25 seconds is 8.75 m/s.
        </li>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[1,1+h]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{1+h-1}\amp = \frac{-5((1+h)^2)+20(1+h)-(-5(1^2)+20(1))}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-5(h^2+2h+1)+20(1+h)-15}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-5h^2-10h-5+20+20h-15}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-5h^2+10h}{h}=\frac{(-5h+10)h}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = -5h+10.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the height of the rocket between 1 and <m>1+h</m> seconds is <m>-5h+10</m> m/s.
        </li>
          
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a}\amp = \frac{-5((a+h)^2)+20(a+h)-(-5(a^2)+20(a))}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-5(a^2+2ah+h^2)+20(a+h)-(-5a^2+20a)}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-5a^2-10ah-5h^2+20a+20h+5a^2-20a}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-10ah-5h^2+20h}{h}=\frac{(-10a-5h+20)h}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = -10a-5h+20.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the height of the rocket between <m>a</m> and <m>a+h</m> seconds is <m>-10a-5h+20</m> m/s.

      <p>
        Consider a restaurant, whose weekly revenue, <m>t</m> weeks after opening is <m>R(t)=60-40e^{-0.05t}</m> thousand dollars.  Find the average rates of change in weekly revenue over the following periods of time:
        <ul>

        We can use either the Desmos calculator above, or algebra:
        <ul>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>R(t)</m> over the interval <m>[1,3]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{R(3)-R(1)}{3-1}\amp = \frac{60-40e^{-0.05(3)}-(60-40e^{-0.05(1)})}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-40e^{-0.05(3)}+40e^{-0.05(1)}}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\approx 1.81042896.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the weekly revenue between 1 and 3 weeks is about <m>\$1810.43</m>.
        </li>
          <li> The average rate of change of <m>R(t)</m> over the interval <m>[2,2.5]</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{R(2.5)-R(2)}{2.5-2}\amp = \frac{60-40e^{-0.05(2.5)}-(60-40e^{-0.05(2)})}{0.5}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{-40e^{-0.05(2.5)}+40e^{-0.05(2)}}{0.5}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\approx 1.78724123611.</mrow>
          </md>
          So the average rate of change in the weekly revenue between 2 and 2.5 weeks is about <m>\$1787.24</m>.
