        In this section, we count the number of ways to make selections <em>without</em> order.

    <title>Combinations </title>
  <p>
    Recall that in <xref ref="Sec_Permutation"/> we counted the number of ways to take the letters <m> A, B, C, D, E </m> pick 3 and arrange them.  This was <m>P(5,3)=60</m>.  We now ask ourselves, how many ways are there to pick 3 of these 5 letters?  That is, what if we ignored the arrangement aspect of <m>P(5,3)</m>?
    

  </p>

  <p>
    We previously listed these results, but let's do so again, in a different manner this time.

    <me>
    \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    ABC \amp ABD \amp ABE \amp ACD \amp ACE \amp ADE \amp BCD \amp BCE \amp BDE \amp CDE\\
    ACB \amp ADB \amp AEB \amp ADC \amp AEC \amp AED \amp BDC \amp BEC \amp BED \amp CED\\
    BAC \amp BAD \amp BAE \amp CAD \amp CAE \amp DAE \amp CBD \amp CBE \amp DBE \amp DCE\\
    BCA \amp BDA \amp BEA \amp CDA \amp CEA \amp DEA \amp CDB \amp CEB \amp DEB \amp DEC\\
    CAB \amp DAB \amp EAB \amp DAC \amp EAC \amp EAD \amp DBC \amp EBC \amp EBD \amp ECD\\
    CBA \amp DBA \amp EBA \amp DCA \amp ECA \amp EDA \amp DCB \amp ECB \amp EDB \amp EDC\\
    \hline
    \end{array}
  </me>

  Grouping the arrangements this way, we can see there are really only 10 selections without order: <me>ABC, ABD, ABE, ACE, ADE, BCD, BCE, BDE, CDE.</me>

  We can get these ten by taking the <m>P(5,3)=60</m> arrangements, and arranging them into columns of <m>3!=6</m>, giving us <m>\frac{P(5,3)}{3!}=\frac{60}{6}=10</m> columns.  The <m>3!</m> denotes the number of ways we can arrange any choice of 3 letters.  This may be generalized:

    <title>Combination</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given <m>n</m> objects, the number of ways to select <m>r</m> of them <em>without order</em>, also called a <term>combination</term> is: <me>C(n,r)=\frac{P(n,r)}{r!}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.</me>
        This is also commonly denoted <m>{n\choose r}</m>, which we will avoid to prevent confusion with fractions.
      </p>
    </statement>
   </definition> 

   <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
    If you had 10 books, how many ways could you select 4 of them to lend a friend?  What about 6 books?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        To select four books out of ten, this would be <m>C(10,4)=\frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!}=\frac{10}{4!6!}=210</m>.  To select six books out of ten, this would be <m>C(10,6)=\frac{10!}{6!(10-6)!}=\frac{10}{6!4!}=210</m>.   We can see it here:
        <interactive desmos="w8bax0xk9j"/>
      </p>  
    </solution>  
   </example> 

    <p>
      Notice that the number of ways to pick 4 books out of 10 is the same as picking 6.  This may seem strange, but picking 4 books to lend, is the same as picking 6 books to keep.  This leads us to the following:

  <remark>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the following about combinations.
      <ul>
        <li> <m>C(n,n)=1</m>.  There is only one way to pick <m>n</m> of <m>n</m> objects.  Pick them all.</li>
        <li> <m>C(n,r)=C(n,n-r)</m>.  Picking <m>r</m> objects is the same as selecting <m>n-r</m> objects to <em>not</em> pick. </li>
        <li> <m>C(n,0)=1</m>.  Combine the above facts.  Alternatively, the only selection of no objects is the empty selection.</li>

  <title>Further Counting</title>

  <p>Sometimes our counting situations can get fairly complex.  In addition to <xref ref="RemarkMultiplication"/> we have:</p>


  <remark xml:id="RemarkAddition">
  <title>Addition Principle</title>
If we have to choose from one item from <m>S_1, \ldots S_r</m> sets, each with <m>m_1, \ldots m_s</m> choices, and there are no overlaps, then the number of ways to do this is <me> m_1+\cdots m_s.</me>

</remark>  

<example>
 <statement>
  <p>
    Suppose you wanted to pick a committee of  3, 4 or 5 out of 20 people.  How many ways can you do this?
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    There are <m>C(20,3)</m> ways to pick a commttee of 3, <m>C(20,4)</m> ways to pick a commttee of 4 and <m>C(20,5)</m> ways to pick a commttee of 5.  So the total number of ways to pick commttees is <me>C(20,3)+C(20,4)+C(20,5)=1140+4845+15504=21489.</me>  Note that there are no overlaps between these selections, they may share people, but there is no 3 person committee who is also a 4 person committee etc.
   </p>
 </solution>
</example>

<example>
 <statement>
  <p>
    Suppose you wanted to pick a committee of  4 professors, 8 Mathematicians and 12 Historians.
    <ol>
      <li>How many ways could you do this?</li>
      <li>How many ways can you do this if two are Mathematicians, and two are Historians?</li>
    </ol>  

  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    Consider:
    <ol>
      <li>In this situation, we are simply picking 4 out of 20 so <m>C(20,4)=4845</m></li>
      <li>Note that since we are picking <em>both</em> 2 Mathematicians and 2 Historians, not one or the other, that the Multiplication Principle, not the Addition Principle applies, so <m>C(8,2)\cdot C(12,2)=28\cdot 66=1848</m>.  We can think of this as 28 ways of picking Mathematicians, 66 ways of picking historians, and 1848 ways of putting the Math and History pairs together.</li>

      Suppose there were 15 apples, 5 of which are poisened. How many ways are there to pick 4 apples so that:
      <ol>
        <li>Without restrictions?</li>
        <li>None of the apples are poisened?</li>
        <li>All of the apples are poisened?</li>
        <li> Exactly two apples are poisened?</li>
        <li> Not more than 1 apple is poisened?</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>  
  <solution>
    <p>
      We note that there are 11 non-poisened apples.
      <ol>
        <li>Ths is picking 4 of 15 objects so <m>C(15,4)=1365</m>.</li>
        <li>Ths is picking 4 of 11 objects so <m>C(11,4)=330</m>.</li>
        <li>Ths is picking 4 of 5 objects so <m>C(5,4)=5</m>.</li>
        <li>Ths is picking 2 of 5 objects to be posiened, 2 of 11 objects for not poisened, and combining these selections, so  <m>C(5,2)\cdot C(11,2)=10\cdot55 =550.</m>.</li>
        <li> This is either no apples poisened, which has 330 possibilies as seen above, or 1 apple poisened, counted <m>C(5,1)\cdot C(11,3)=5\cdot 165=825</m>.  Thus we have <m>330+825=1155</m> ways to have no or one poisened apple.</li>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A caterer offers 10 entrees, 4 of which are vegetarian.  How many ways can you pick 3 entrees:
      <ol>
        <li>Without restrictions?</li>
        <li>None of the dishes are vegetarian?</li>
        <li>All of the dishes are vegetarian?</li>
        <li> Exactly one of the dishes is vegetarian?</li>
        <li> At least one of the dishes are vegetarian?</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>  
  <solution>
    <p>
      We note that there are 6 non-vegetarian dishes.
      <ol>
        <li>Ths is picking 3 of 10 objects so <m>C(10,3)=120</m>.</li>
        <li>Ths is picking 3 of 6 objects so <m>C(6,3)=20</m>.</li>
        <li>Ths is picking 3 of 4 objects so <m>C(4,3)=4</m>.</li>
        <li>Ths is picking 1 of 4 objects to be vegetarian, 2 of 6 objects for not vegetarian, and combining these selections, so  <m>C(4,1)\cdot C(6,2)=4\cdot15 =60.</m>.</li>
        <li> This is one, two or three vegetarian dishes, so <me>C(4,1)\cdot C(6,2)+C(4,2)\cdot C(6,1)+C(4,3)\cdot C(6,0)=4\cdot15 + 6\cdot 6+4\cdot 1 =100 </me> ways to have at least one vegetarian dish.  Or if we took all 120 caterung options, and removed the 20 without vegetarian options, we would have <m>120-20=100</m> dishes.</li>
      </ol>
