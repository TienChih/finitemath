    <title>Long Term Behavior</title>
    <p>
      When we consider a polynomial <m>p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x^1+a_0</m>,
      we notice that no matter how big the coefficients <m>a_{n-1}</m> through <m>a_0</m> are,
      they will all eventually be made insignificant by <m>x^n</m> for some sufficiently large values of <m>x</m>.
      Thus we have the following fact:
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The long term behavior of <m>p(x)</m> is determined <term>completely</term>
        by it's leading term <m>a_nx^n</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      To see this, consider the plots of <m>y=x^3</m> and <m>y=1000x^2</m>.
        <interactive desmos="a6xxwxtigr" />
        One thousand is a huge coefficient for sure!  But will that matter so much when <m>x</m> is in the thousands, the millions, the trillions?  Eventually <m>x\cdot x^2</m> will be much greater than <m>1000\cdot x^2</m> when <m>x</m> is big enough.  So if we plotted <m>y=x^3-1000x^2</m> next to <m>y=x^3</m>
        <interactive desmos="1kud4u5ius" />
        We see that they have the same general shape.
    </p>  
    <p>
      So we have 2 things to consider,
      whether or not <m>a_n</m> is positive or negative,
      or whether or not <m>n</m> is even or odd.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>a_n>0</m>, then there are 2 possibilities:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>n</m> is even, (like <m>x^2, x^4, x^6)</m>,
            then <m>a_nx^n</m> cannot be negative,
            so <m>p(x)</m> will tend to positive infinity as <m>x</m> goes to either positive or negative infinity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>n</m> is odd, (like <m>x, x^3, x^5)</m>,
            then <m>a_nx^n</m> is positive as long as <m>x</m> is positive,
            so <m>p(x)</m> will tend to positive infinity as <m>x</m> goes to either positive infinity,
            and <m>a_nx^n</m> will go to negative infinity as x goes to negative infinity.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, if <m>a_n\lt 0</m>, everything is flipped upside down.
      We can summarize as follows:
      <ul>
        <li> If <m>a_n>0, n</m> is even, <m>p(x)\to \infty </m> as <m>x\to \pm \infty</m>.</li>
        <li> If <m>a_n\lt 0, n</m> is even, <m>p(x)\to -\infty </m> as <m>x\to \pm \infty</m>.</li>
        <li> If <m>a_n>0, n</m> is odd, <m>p(x)\to \infty </m> as <m>x\to \infty</m>, and <m>p(x)\to -\infty </m> as <m>x\to -\infty</m>.</li>
        <li> If <m>a_n\lt 0, n</m> is odd, <m>p(x)\to -\infty </m> as <m>x\to \infty</m>, and <m>p(x)\to \infty </m> as <m>x\to -\infty</m>.</li>  
      </ul>

  <subsection>
    <title>Short Term Behavior</title>
    <p>
      The first thing one can always do when analyzing the short term behavior of <m>p(x)</m> is find the <m>y</m>-intercept.
      The <m>y</m> intercept is just the point on the curve of the function when <m>x=0</m>,
      so this is <m>p(0)=a_0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the <term>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</term>,
      we can write <m>p(x)=a_nx^n+\cdots +a_0</m> as:
      <me>
        p(x)=a_n(x-r_1)^{m_1}(x-r_2)^{m_2}\cdots (x-r_k)^{m_k}\cdot q_1(x)q_2(x)\cdots q_\ell(x)
      </me>
      where the <m>q_i(x)</m> are irreducible quadratics.
      We call <m>r_1, \ldots, r_k</m> the
      <em>roots</em> of <m>r(x)</m>,
      where root <m>r_i</m> has <em>multiplicty</em> <m>m_i</m>.
      What this means is if we plug <m>r_i</m> into <m>p(x)</m>,
      we end up with 0, since that linear factor ends up being 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The behavior of <m>p(x)</m> around these roots is determined by the multiplicity of that root.
      We know that <m>p(x)</m> will be 0 at those roots,
      so the question is whether or not the polynomial crosses the <m>x</m> axis at a given roots,
      or bounces off the axis:

    <p>
      We notice that <m>p(x)</m> only changes sign when it's factors <m>(x-r_i)^{m_i}</m> changes sign.
      But <m>(x-r_i)^{m_i}</m> only changes sign if <m>m_i</m> is odd.
      So we have the following fact:
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The polynomial <m>p(x)</m>
        <q>crosses</q>
        the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>r_i</m> if <m>m_i</m> is odd and
        <q>bounces</q>
        if <m>m_i</m> is even.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example>
      <title>Behavior of a polynomial</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let
          <me>
            p(x)=x^3-3x^2=x^2(x-3)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <interactive desmos="iy0chaljdq" />
          Since it is a odd degree polynomial with positive leading coefficient,
          it goes up to <m>\infty</m> as <m>x</m> goes to <m>\infty</m> and down to <m>-\infty</m> as <m>x</m> goes to <m>-\infty</m>.
          We also see that <m>p(x)=0</m> whenever <m>x=0</m> or <m>x=3</m>.
          The multiplicity of 0 is 2, and the multiplicity of 3 is 1, which are even and odd respectively,
          so <m>p(x)</m>
          <q>bounces</q>
          at <m>x=0</m> and crosses at <m>x=1</m>.

        <p>
          <interactive desmos="wmr67oopgj" />  Since it is a even degree polynomial with positive leading coefficient,
          it goes up to <m>\infty</m> as <m>x</m> goes to both positive and negative <m>\infty</m>.
