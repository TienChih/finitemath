      <p>
        In <xref ref="Sec_Conditional"/> we saw that some events can change the likelihood of other events.  If we consider something like smoking and lung cancer, it's well understood that whether or not one smokes differentiates the probability that one contracts lung cancer.  Thus, we should be able to predict lung cancer rates from smoking rates, and vice versa.  We will make that formal here.

    <title>A Motivating Example </title>

  <p>  Recall <xref ref="ExercisePlants"/>, if we rename our events, let <m>Y</m> denote <q>built in plant A</q> and <m>X</m> denotes <q>passes inspection</q>, then we have <m>P(X|Y)=0.85, P(X|Y^c)=0.7</m> measure the 85% chance for vehicles built in plant A to pass inspection, and the 70% built in B to pass inspection.  Then, how many vehicles pass inspection depends entirely on how many vehicles are manufactured in A as opposed to B.

  <interactive desmos="a4gs4jrer2"/>
    
  If 100% of the vehicles were built in plant A, then naturally 85% of cars would pass inspection.  If they were all built in B, then only 70% would pass inspection.  For any mix of plants A and B, the number who pass inspection should be something in between.

  <title>Bayes's Theorem</title>

  <theorem xml:id="TheoremBayes">
    <title>Bayes's Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given events <m>X, Y</m>: <me>P(X) =P(X|Y)P(Y)+P(X|Y^c)(1-P(Y)).</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
   <proof>     

  <p>Recall that:
    <md>
      <mrow> P(X)\amp =P(X\cap Y)+P(X\cap Y^c)</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =P(X|Y)P(Y)+P(X|Y^c)P(Y^c)</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =P(X|Y)P(Y)+P(X|Y^c)(1-P(Y))</mrow>
    </md>  


 </p>   

</proof>
</theorem>


<p>
  So if 40% of the vehicles are built in plant A, then <m>P(Y)=0.4</m>, and we should be able to determine how many vehicles pass inspection.  We first note that the percent of vehicles who are from plant A and pass inspection is <me>P(X\cap Y)=P(X|Y)P(Y)=(0.85)(0.4)=0.34.</me>  Next, to see the percent of vehicles who are from plant B and pass inspection is <me>P(X\cap Y^c)=P(X|Y^c)P(Y^c)=P(X|Y^c)(1-P(Y))=(0.7)(0.6)=0.42.</me>  So the total percent of cars who pass inspection is:

 <md>
      <mrow> P(X)\amp =P(X\cap Y)+P(X\cap Y^c)</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =P(X|Y)P(Y)+P(X|Y^c)P(Y^c)</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =P(X|Y)P(Y)+P(X|Y^c)(1-P(Y))</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =(0.85)(0.4)+(0.7)(0.6)</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =0.34+0.42=0.76</mrow>
    </md>  

    We can see this below:

<interactive desmos="ndd9pzxcqp"/>

</p>  

<p>
  The relation in <xref ref="TheoremBayes" /> should also work the other way, if we saw that 80% of the vehicles pass inspection, what proportion of them were built in Plant A?  We are given <m>P(X)=0.8</m> and asked to find <m>P(Y)</m>.  So:

<md>
      <mrow> P(X)\amp=P(X|Y)P(Y)+P(X|Y^c)(1-P(Y))</mrow>
      <mrow> 0.8 \amp =(0.85)P(Y)+(0.7)(1-P(Y)</mrow>
      <mrow> 0.8 \amp =(0.85)P(Y)+(0.7)-(0.7)P(Y)</mrow>
      <mrow> 0.1 \amp =(0.15)P(Y)</mrow>
      <mrow> P(Y) \amp =\frac{.1}{.15}=\frac{2}{3}\approx 0.666666667.</mrow>

    We can see this below:
