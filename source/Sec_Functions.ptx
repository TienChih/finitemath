      <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we introduce the definition of a function, function notation, and some properties that functiond have.
      </p>

     </introduction> 

  <subsection>
    <title>What is a function?</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>function</term> <m>f</m> is a rule that assigns to each element from one set exactly one element from
another set.
        </p>
        <p> The set of all possible inputs is called the <term>domain</term>, and the set of all possible outputs is the <term>range</term>.</p>
        <p>
         For any <m>x</m> in the domain, <m>f(x)</m> denotes the appropriate output in the range.  So in the expression say <me>f(a)=b,</me>  we have that <m>a</m> is an element of the domain, and <m>f(a), b</m> an element of the range. </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note that in general, neither the domain nor range need neccesarily be collections of numbers, and that any set is potentially a domain or range.

 <p>In the above diagram, we can see that this is a function.  The domain is <m>\{\text{Andrew, Brianna, Connie, Deng}\}</m>, the range is <m>\{\text{Chocolate, Mint}\}</m>.  Avacado is <em>not</em> in the range, since no element of the domain evaluates to Avacado.  If we name the function <m>\alpha</m>, we would have <m>\alpha(\text{Andrew})=\text{Chocolate}=\alpha(\text{Brianna})</m> and <m>\alpha(\text{Connie})=\text{Mint}=\alpha(\text{Deng})</m>.</p>

 <p>In this case, we can see this relation is <em>not</em> a function.  Let's call it <m>L</m> for lunch.  We see that many of our subjects had more than one item for lunch.  So If we asked about <m>L(\text{Andrew})</m>, it's not clear if this should be Hamburger or Fries, or a Soda.  Recall that the definition of a function assigns <em>one</em> output per input.</p>

  <title>Which are functions?</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which of the following assignments or relations are functions?
          <ol>
            <li>To each student <m>S</m>, we assign to them their student id number.</li>
            <li>To each person <m>P</m>, we let <m>N(P)</m> be the name of <m>P</m>'s' parent.</li>
            <li>We assign <m>x</m> to <m>a(x)</m> as follows:
              <me>
          \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|} \hline x \amp  1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\amp 5\\ \hline a(x)\amp 3\amp 2\amp 3\amp -27\amp 3\\ \hline \end{array}
        </me>
            </li>
            <li>We assign <m>x</m> to <m>b(x)</m> as follows:
              <me>
          \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|} \hline x \amp  1\amp 2\amp 2\amp 3\amp 3\\ \hline b(x)\amp 6\amp 7\amp 8\amp 9\amp 10\\ \hline \end{array}

            </li>


          </ol>  
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li> This is a function, since each student has one and only one student id number.</li>
            <li> This is <em>not</em> a function, since there is not a unique parent for each person, and thus potentially more than on assignment.</li>
            <li> This is a function because each input is assigned one output.
            </li>
            <li> This is <em>not</em> a function because  inputs 2 and 3 are assigned more than one output.

  <subsection>
    <title>Real valued functions</title>
  <p>
    In this course, we will focus on real-valued functions, where the inputs and outputs are real numbers.  These are typically defined <em>algebraiacally</em>  where the inputs are numbers, and the outputs are algebraic operations performed on those numbers.
  </p>  
  <p>
    Consider <m>f(x)=4-x^2</m>.  This is an assignment that assigns to each real number <m>x</m> a real number <m>4-x^2</m>:
    <ul>
            <li> <m>f(0)=4-0^2=4</m>.</li>
            <li> <m>f(2)=4-2^2=0</m>.</li>
            <li> <m>f(-1)=4-(-1)^2=3</m>.</li>
            <li> <m>f(10)=4-10^2=-96</m>.</li>
            <li> <m>f(a)=4-a^2</m>.</li>
          </ul> 
    We can see in the Desmos graph below that by adjusting <m>a</m>, we may view all the potential inputs and outputs of <m>f</m>.
    <interactive desmos="rk0jkqcdpd" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes we express real valued functions as an algebraic relation between an independent variable (typically <m>x</m> but not necissarily) as an input, and a dependent vairable (typically <m>y</m> but not necissarily) as an output.  To check to see if a relation is a function, we often employ the <term>vertical line test</term>: we check to see that for each vertical line, it intersects the curve of the relation at most once, that is, each input only has one output.
  </p>  
  <p>
    We can see that the relation <m>y=\sqrt{10-x}</m> expresses <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>:
    <interactive desmos="1sz5ekljc7" />
    Each valid input of <m>x</m> has only one output.  However, the relation <m>y^2+x^2=25</m>:
    <interactive desmos="ewds3uv53x" /> as several inputs generate two outputs.
  </p>
  
  <exercise>
    <title>When is a relation a function?</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which of the following relations express <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>?
          <ol>
            <li><m>y=x^2+x</m>.</li>
            <li><m>x=1-y^2</m>.</li>
            <li><m>y^2=x+2</m>.</li>
            <li><m>x=y+3</m>.</li>

          </ol>  
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Consider the following:
          <ol>
            <li> This is a function, since each <m>x</m> only has one associated one <m>y</m> value.</li>
            <li> This is <em>not</em> a function, since there is not a unique  <m>y</m> for each <m>x</m>.  So for example, when <m>x=1</m>, we have that <m>y=1, -1</m> both satisfy this relation.</li>
            <li> This is <em>not</em> a function, since there is not a unique  <m>y</m> for each <m>x</m>.  So for example, when <m>x=2</m>, we have that <m>y=2, -2</m> both satisfy this relation.</li>
            <li>  This is a function, since each <m>x</m> only has one associated one <m>y</m> value.</li>
            


          </ol> 
           <interactive desmos="wkacj4q5du" />

            We can see the visualizations of these curves above, and see which satisfy the "vertical line test".

  <subsection>
    <title>Domain and Range</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>interval </term> is the collection of all real numbers subject to certain bounds:
         <ul>
          <li> <m>[a,b]</m>  represents all real numbers <m>x</m> where <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>.</li>
          <li> <m>[a,b)</m>  represents all real numbers <m>x</m> where <m>a\leq x \lt  b </m>. </li>
          <li> <m>(a,b]</m>  represents all real numbers <m>x</m> where <m>a\lt  x\leq b</m>. </li>
          <li> <m>(a,b)</m>  represents all real numbers <m>x</m> where <m>a\lt x \lt b   </m>. </li>
         </ul>
         
         In other words <m>[,]</m> include the endpoints and <m>(,)</m> exclude them.  Note that we may use <m>\infty, -\infty</m> as endpoints, but they cannot be included as they are not real numbers.
         </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

  <p>  
    Generally speaking for real valued functions, any real number may be an element of the domain, unless otherwise specified, or unless it would result in an undefined arithmetic operation.
  </p>
  <example>
    <title>Domain and Range of a function</title>
    <statement>
  <p>
    Consider the domain and range of <m>f(x)=x^2-2</m>.  No matter what the value of <m>x</m> is, that value may be squared, and 2 may be subtracted from the result.  Thus the domain is <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>, every real number is a valid input. </p> <p> Note that <m>x^2</m> has minimal value 0, so <m>x^2-2\geq -2</m> and the range of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>[-2,\infty)</m>, numbers greater than or equal to 2 are valid outputs.
    <interactive desmos="026arve1iy" />
  </p>
</statement>
</example>

<example>
  <title>Domain and Range of a function</title>
    <statement>
  <p>
    Consider the domain and range of <m>g(x)=\frac{2}{3-x} </m>.  In this case, we note that 2 divided by any non-zero number is well-defined.  However, we cannot divide two by zero.   Thus the domain is <m>(-\infty, 3)\cup (3,\infty)</m>, every real number other than 3 is a valid input, since <m>\frac{2}{3-3}=\frac{2}{0}</m> is undefined. </p> <p>  Similarly, there is no value we may divide 2 by to achieve 0, and thus the range is <m>(-\infty, 0)\cup (0,\infty)</m>, every real value other than zero is a valid output.

<example>
  <title>Domain and Range of a function</title>
    <statement>
  <p>
    Consider the domain and range of <m>h(x)=\sqrt{2+x} </m>.  In this case, we note that we may take the squareroot of zero, but not negative numbers. We note then that <m>2+x\geq0</m> for <m>h(x)</m> to be defined.  Thus the domain is <m>(-2,\infty)</m>, every real number greater than or equal to -2 is a valid input. </p> <p>  Similarly, the output of the square root function is non-negative, and thus the range is <m>[0,\infty)</m>, every real value greater than or equal to zero is a valid output.

  <p>
    Find the domain and range of <m>a(x)=x^3-2</m>.

</statement>

  <p>
    Both the domain and range are <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>.

  <title>Find Domain and Range 2</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
    Find the domain and range of <m>b(x)=\sqrt{x^2-4}</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    Note that <m>b(x)</m> is defined so long as <m>x^2-4\geq 0</m> which occurs when <m>x\leq -2</m> and <m>x\geq 2</m>.
    Thus the domain is <m>(-\infty, -2)\cup (2, \infty)</m>.  Since the output of the radical function is non-negative, we have that the domain is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.

<exercise>
  <title>Find Domain and Range 3</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
    Find the domain and range of <m>c(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}+2</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    Note that <m>c(x)</m> is defined so long as <m>\sqrt{x}\neq 0</m>  and is defined, which occurs when <m>x>0</m>.
    Thus the domain is <m>(0, \infty)</m>.  Since the output of the radical function is non-negative, so are the outputs of <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</m>, excluding zero since that is not possible.  Then when we add 1,  we have that the domain is <m>(1,\infty)</m>.

    Note then that <m>d(-3)=9, d(-2)=4, d(1)=1, d(2)=4</m>.  So the range is <m>\{1,4,9\}</m>.

  <title>Evaluating functions</title>
<p>The algebraic definition of real valued function is a guide on how they are to be evaluated.  It may be that we will wish to evaluate these at real number values, but it is possible we will want to evluate them at algebraic expressions themselves.</p>
