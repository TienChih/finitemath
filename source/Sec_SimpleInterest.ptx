  <title>Simple Interest</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we discuss <em>simple interest</em>, a way of computing interest based solely on the principal.
    </p>
  </introduction>  
  <p>
    <definition>
      Given a initial investment or loan of <m>\$P</m>, often called a <em>principal</em> or <em>present value</em> of an investment/loan, then the <term>simple interest</term> of that principal at a rate of <m>r</m> per time unit, over <m>n</m> time units will be <me>I=Prn.</me>
    </definition>  
  </p>  

  <example>
    <title>Simple interest computations</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>If you invest <m>\$500</m> at a rate of <m>1\%</m> simple interest a month, then in 18 months, you will have accumulated <m>i=500\cdot 0.01\cdot18=\$90</m> of interest. </li>
             <li>If you put <m>\$1000</m> at a rate of <m>8\%</m> annual simple interest, then in 6 years, you will have accumulated <m>i=1000\cdot 0.08\cdot6=\$240</m> of interest. </li>
              <li>If you borrow <m>\$5000</m> from a loan shark at a rate of <m>2\%</m> simple interest a day, then in a week, you will have accumulated <m>i=5000\cdot 0.02\cdot7=\$700</m> of interest. </li>
          </ol>  
      </p>
  </statement>
    </example> 
    <p> Assuming no payments or additional principals are taken out, this interest is accumalated in addition to the original principal.  If we let <m>A</m> denote the accumalated future value: <me> A=P+It</me> at time <m>t</m>.</p>
  <p>
    Let's say you take out a loan at $100 dollars and are charged 5% monthly simple interest.
    What this means is that every month, 5% of your initial debt is added on as interest.
    Over time you would see something like:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{ Month }  \amp  \text{ Debt } \\ \hline 0 \amp  100\\ 1\amp  100+(.05)(100)(1)=100+5=105\\ 2\amp  100+(.05)(100)(2)=100+10=110\\ 3 \amp  100+(.05)(100(3)=100+15=115\\ \vdots \amp  \vdots\\ n \amp  100+(.05)(100)n=100+5n\\ \hline \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    So in say 5 months you would owe <m>100+5\cdot 5=\$125</m>.
    In general, we could track how much we owe <m>A</m> in month <m>m</m> as
    <m>A=100+5m</m>, which is, as we know,
    a linear equation:
    <interactive desmos="3sk7jwznnx"  />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now of course,
    this could be adjusted to any number of situations.
    You could take out a loan for <m>P</m> dollars.
    You could have a <m>r</m> interest rate every time period which doesn't have to be a month.
    Then the future value <m>A</m> after <m>m</m> time periods would be:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{ Time Unit }  \amp  \text{ Debt } \\ \hline 0 \amp  P\\ 1\amp  P+rP\\ 2\amp  P+rP+rP=P+2rP\\ 3 \amp  P+2rP+rP=P+3rp\\ \vdots \amp  \vdots\\ m \amp  P+mrP=P(1+mr)\\ \hline \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This still expresses <m>A</m> as a line with <m>y</m>-intercept <m>P</m> and slope <m>rP</m>:

  <p>
    So suppose you lend your friend some money at 2% weekly interest,
    and after 10 weeks they owe you $240, how much did you lend them?
    Well, we know that in this case
    <m>r=0.02,
    w=10</m> and the future value <m>A=240</m> so:
    <md>
      <mrow>A\amp = P+Prn</mrow>
      <mrow>240\amp = P+P(10)(.02)</mrow>
      <mrow>240\amp = 1.2P</mrow>
      <mrow>P\amp = 200</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    So <m>P=\$200</m> is how much they borrowed.
    One can verify this graphically:

  <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If I invest <m>\$1000 </m> at 12% simple annual interest, how long until my investment is worth <m>\$2000</m>?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We're given <m>P=1000, A=2000, r=0.12</m>.  Thus we have:
          <md>
      <mrow>A\amp = P+Prn</mrow>
      <mrow>2000\amp = 1000+(1000)(.12)n</mrow>
      <mrow>1000\amp = 120n</mrow>
      <mrow>n\amp = \frac{1000}{120}\approx 8.333\ldots</mrow>
      </md>
      So in 8 years and four months:

        </p>
      </solution>    
    </exercise> 

      <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If I borrow <m>\$750 </m> and in 5 years, I owe <m>\$1000</m>, how much was the annual simple interest rate?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We're given <m>P=750, A=1000, n=5</m>.  Thus we have:
          <md>
      <mrow>A\amp = P+Prn</mrow>
      <mrow>1000\amp = 750+(750)r(5)</mrow>
      <mrow>250\amp = 3750r</mrow>
      <mrow>r\amp = \frac{250}{3750}\approx 0.066\ldots</mrow>
      </md>
      So about 6.67\% annual simple interest:
      <interactive desmos="turr6ag5tb"  />
    
        </p>
      </solution>    
    </exercise> 


    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How much should I invest so that in 20 years, I have <m>\$10,000</m> at an 8% annual simple interest rate?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We're given <m>A=10000, n=20, r=0.08</m>.  Thus we have:
          <md>
      <mrow>A\amp = P+Prn</mrow>
      <mrow>10000\amp = P+P(0.08)(20)</mrow>
      <mrow>10000\amp = P(1+1.6)</mrow>
      <mrow>P\amp = \frac{10000}{2.6}\approx 3846.15\ldots</mrow>
      </md>
      So about <m>\$3846.15</m> in inital investment:
      <interactive desmos="slwvaqvcst"  />
    
        </p>
      </solution>    
    </exercise> 

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How much should will I owe in 15 weeks, if I borrow <m>\$5,000</m> at an 2% weekly simple interest rate?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We're given <m>P=5000, n=15, r=0.02</m>.  Thus we have:
          <md>
      <mrow>A\amp = P+Prn</mrow>
      <mrow>A\amp = 5000+5000(0.02)(15)= 6500.00</mrow>
      </md>
      So  <m>\$6500.00</m> in debt:
      <interactive desmos="9hfwu4k50w"  />
    
        </p>
      </solution>
