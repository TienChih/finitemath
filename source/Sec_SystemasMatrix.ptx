  <title>Representing a System of Linear Equations as a Matrix</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Given a system of equations, we can try to encode that information in a matrix:
    </p>
    <p>
      So for example the system of equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>2x+3y+z\amp = 3</mrow>
        <mrow>-2x+4y+2z\amp = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>x-y+2z\amp = 3</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Would have matrix representation:
      <me>
        \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 2 \amp  3 \amp  1\amp  3\\ -2 \amp  4 \amp  2 \amp  0\\ 1 \amp  -1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \end{array} \right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of numbers,
      each number is an <term>entry</term> of the matrix.
      In the above example,
      the vertical line is a visual reminder to separate the constant terms from the variables.
      A matrix displayed this way is an
      <term>augmented matrix</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By letting each column of a matrix represent a different variable or constant and arranging the linear equations into rows,
      one can write any linear system of equations as an augmented matrix.
      Conversely, if you have a matrix:
      <me>
        \left( \begin{array}{rr|r} 1 \amp  2 \amp  4\\ 3 \amp  3  \amp  9 \end{array} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This represent the system of equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>x+2y\amp = 4</mrow>
        <mrow>3x+3y\amp = 9</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Solving Systems of Linear Equations</title>
    <p>
      So let's consider the above system/matrix:
      <me>
        \left( \begin{array}{rr|r} 1 \amp  2 \amp  4\\ 3 \amp  3  \amp  9 \end{array} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are allowed to manipulate this matrix in a number of ways.
      Remembering that each row represents a linear equation:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>You can multiply any row by a non-zero multiple</term>.
            We can do this because say,
            the solutions to <m>x+2y=4</m> are the same as the solutions to <m>-x-2y=-4</m> or <m>2x+4y=8</m>,
            so we're not adding in new solutions or removing existing solutions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>You can add to any row,
            the multiple of any row.</term> Adding a linear equality to another linear equality preserves the solutions to both equations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>You can rearrange the rows.</term>
            The solutions to a system of equations does not depend on the order in which they appear.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      So our goal here is to change this system into one where it's much easier to see what the solution is.
      The best way to do this,
      is to not have all these x's and y's, I want 2 equations:
      <m>x=?, y=??</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So:
      <md>
        <mrow>\left( \begin{array}{rr|r} 1 \amp  2 \amp  4\\ 3 \amp  3  \amp  9 \end{array} \right)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>(1/3)R_2\mapsto R_2 \left( \begin{array}{rr|r} 1 \amp  2 \amp  4\\ 1 \amp  1  \amp  3 \end{array} \right)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>(-1)R_1+R_2\mapsto R_2 \left( \begin{array}{rr|r} 1 \amp  2 \amp  4\\ 0 \amp  -1  \amp  -1 \end{array} \right)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>(-1)R_2\mapsto R_2 \left( \begin{array}{rr|r} 1 \amp  2 \amp  4\\ 0 \amp  1  \amp  1 \end{array} \right)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>(-2)R_2+R_1\mapsto R_1 \left( \begin{array}{rr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  2\\ 0 \amp  1  \amp  1 \end{array} \right)\amp \amp</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      What system of equations of this?
      It is:
      <md>
        <mrow>x+0y\amp = 2</mrow>
        <mrow>0x+y\amp = 1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which must mean: <m>x=2, y=1</m>, alright!
      By the way, one can test your answers to see if they are correct!
      <me>
        1(2)+2(1)=4, 3(1)+3(2)=9
      </me>
      so it checks out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A matrix with 1's across the diagonal,
      and 0's above and below these 1's
      (as above)
      is called <term>reduced row-echelon form</term>.
      A process to obtain a reduced row echelon form matrix is called the
      <term>Gauss-Jordan Method</term>.
      The methodology is:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Starting with the first row,
            multiply by a number so it's leading (leftmost) value is 1.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply and add copies of this row to all rows below so that every entry below this leading 1 is a 0.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Repeat steps (1) and (2) for subsequent rows until the last row.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Starting with the bottom row working up,
            repeat steps (1)-(3) except working upwards and making entries
            <term>above</term> the leading 1's 0.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

          This corresponds to augmented matrix:

          Which corresponds to the linear system:

            <mrow>2(1)-(0)+2(-2)\amp = -2</mrow>

          and we have solved our linear system.

    <title>Reduced Row Echelon Form using Technology.</title>
    <p>
      Suppose we wanted to solve the system associated with the augmented matrix:
      <me>
        \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 2 \amp  3 \amp  1\amp  3\\ -2 \amp  4 \amp  2 \amp  0\\ 1 \amp  -1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \end{array} \right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could solve this the same way we did <xref ref="Example_GaussJordan">Example</xref>,
      but your first thought here is probably "I don't want to do this." Yeah,
      me neither.
      One thing to note is that this process of finding a reduced row echelon form of a matrix is fairly mechanical.
      Thus, it is only natural that we should  do this with a machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sage>
        <input>
        A=matrix(QQ, [[2,3,1,3],[-2,4,2,0],[1,-1,2,3]])
        print(A)
        print(A.rref())
        </input>
        <output>
        </output>
      </sage>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first line defines the matrix <m>A</m> with the rows identical to the rows we defined in our above matrix.
      Then the code returns a printout of that matrix,
      and it's reduced row echelon form:
      <me>
        \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0\amp  1\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \end{array} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So <m>x=1, y=0, z=1</m>.
      Is this right?
      Well,
      <md>
        <mrow>2(1)+3(0)+1\amp = 3</mrow>
        <mrow>-2(1)+4(0)+2(1)\amp = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>1-0+2(1)\amp = 3</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Works for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, if you enter the matrix from <xref ref="Example_GaussJordan">Example</xref>,
      and replace the first line with:
    </p>
<pre>
A=matrix(QQ, [[3,2,1,1],[1,1,1,3],[2,-1,2,-2]])
</pre>
    <p>
      You should have the reduced row echelon matrix we achieved earlier.
    </p>

    <title>Infinitely many solutions</title>

      Consider the system:
      <md>
        <mrow>x+2y+z\amp = 3</mrow>
        <mrow>-x+y+0z\amp = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>0x+3y+z\amp = 3</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then by using rref using as <m>A</m>:
    </p>
<pre>
A=matrix(QQ, [[1,2,1,3],[-1,1,0,0],[0,3,1,3]])
</pre>
    <p>
      We would obtain:
      <me>
        \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  1/3\amp  1\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  1/3 \amp  1\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \end{array} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which gives us the system:
      <md>
        <mrow>x+0y+(1/3)z\amp = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>0x+y+(1/3)z\amp = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>0x+0y+0z\amp = 0</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the last line is useless,
      it basically says that <m>0=0</m>,
      which is true but useless.
      Let's break down the remaining equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>x+(1/3)z\amp = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>y+(1/3)z\amp = 1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which can be thought of as:
      <md>
        <mrow>x\amp = 1-(1/3)z</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp = 1-(1/3)z</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So basically what this is saying,
      no matter what <m>z</m> is, you can find <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      So if <m>z=0</m>, then <m>x,y=1</m>.
      But if <m>z=6</m>, then <m>x,y=-1</m>.
      Well, what is <m>z</m>?
      Apparently it can be whatever we want,
      both of the above triplets provide perfectly legitimate solutions to the original system.
      What you see described is a line of solutions.
      The 3 equations describe 3 planes in 3 dimensional (<m>x,y,z)</m> space and they intersect at this line which can be describes as the solution to this equation.

        <mrow>0x+3y+z\amp = 0</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then by using rref using as <m>A</m>:
    </p>
<pre>
A=matrix(QQ, [[1,2,1,3],[-1,1,0,0],[0,3,1,0]])
</pre>
    <p>
      We would obtain:
      <me>
        \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  1/3\amp  1\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  1/3 \amp  1\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \end{array} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which gives us the system:

        <mrow>x+0y+(1/3)z\amp =\amp 1</mrow>
        <mrow>0x+y+(1/3)z\amp =\amp 1</mrow>
        <mrow>0x+0y+0z\amp =\amp 1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what does this last line mean?
      It says that <m>0=1</m>.
      When will this happen?
      Well basically never,
      no choice of <m>x,y,z</m> will ever make this true,
      our 3 planes do not intersect at a point or line or at all,
      so there is no solution.

          A new airline has recently purchased a fleet of Airbus A330-300s, Boeing 767-300ERs, and Boeing Dreamliner 787-9s to meet an estimated demand for 9,300 seats.
          The A330-300s seat 330 passengers and cost $250 million each,
          the 767-300ERs seat 270 passengers and cost $200 million each,
          while the 787-9s seat 240 passengers and cost $250 million each.
          The total cost of the fleet,
          which had twice as many 787-9s as 767s, was $8,100 million.

          By letting <m>x</m> denote the numbere of A330-300's, <m>y</m> denote the number of 767-300ERs and <m>z</m> denote the number of 787-9s,

          First, the total capacity is 9,300 seats:

        <p>
          Next, the total cost is $8,100 million:

          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, there are twice as many 787-9s as 767-300ERs:

          Giving us a system:

          </ol>  
        </p> 
      </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
                We first set up our systems of equations.
                We first note that all 300 people have to walk either along either Anderson or Birmingham, so
                <me>
                  a+b=300
                </me>.
                Next, the 75 at Xavier is the however many people walked down Anderson,
                and take away whoever veered off onto Central so:
                <me>
                  a-c=75
                </me>.
                The 225 people at Yoneda is everyone coming across Birmingham and Central so
                <me>
                  b+c=225
                </me>.
                Thus the system is:
                <md>
                  <mrow>a+b\amp = 300</mrow>
                  <mrow>a-c\amp = 75</mrow>
                  <mrow>b+c\amp = 225</mrow>
                </md>,
                with associated augmented matrix:
                <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  1 \amp  0\amp  300\\ 1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  75\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  225 \end{array} \right)
                </me>.
                So the reduced row echelon form of this is:
                <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  75\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  225\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0\amp  0 \end{array} \right)
                </me>.
                What this tells us is that there is not a unique solution,
                as the system associated with this matrix is:
                <md>
                  <mrow>a-c\amp = 75</mrow>
                  <mrow>b+c\amp = 225</mrow>
                </md>,
                Which is two of the original equations.
                So, depending on what <m>c</m> is,
                this will determine how many people traverse Anderson and Birmingham.
              </p>
            </solution>
            <solution>
              <p>
                If 50 people crossed central,
                how many people crossed Anderson and Birmingham?
                So letting <m>c=50</m>, we would have:
                <md>
                  <mrow>a-c\amp = 75</mrow>
                  <mrow>a-50\amp = 75</mrow>
                  <mrow>a\amp = 125</mrow>
                  <mrow>b+c\amp = 225</mrow>
                  <mrow>b+50\amp = 225</mrow>
                  <mrow>b\amp = 175</mrow>
                </md>,
                So 125 people across Anderson and 175 across Birmingham.
                Another way to do this would be to add an equation <m>c=50</m> to our system:
                <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  1 \amp  0\amp  300\\ 1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  75\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  225\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  50 \end{array} \right)
                </me>.
                Which has reduced row echelon form:
                <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  125\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  175\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1\amp  50\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0\amp  0 \end{array} \right)
                </me>.
                That is <m>a=125, b=125, c=50</m> which is our solution above.
              </p>
           </solution>
           <solution>
              <p>
                If 100 people go through Anderson,
                how many go through Birmingham or Central?
                We can revisit our linear system from (a):
                <md>
                  <mrow>a-c\amp = 75</mrow>
                  <mrow>100-c\amp = 75</mrow>
                  <mrow>c\amp = 25</mrow>
                  <mrow>b+c\amp = 225</mrow>
                  <mrow>b+25\amp = 225</mrow>
                  <mrow>b\amp = 200</mrow>
                </md>,
                so 200 across Birmingham and 25 across Central.
                We can also add the linear equation <m>a=100</m>:
                <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  1 \amp  0\amp  300\\ 1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  75\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  225\\ 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  100 \end{array} \right)
                </me>
                with reduced row echelon form:
                <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  100\\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  200\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1\amp  25\\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  0\amp  0 \end{array} \right)
                </me>.
                So 100 across Anderson, 200 across Birmingham and 25 across Central.
              </p>
            </solution>
      
    </example>


    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An Ice Cream Manufacturer makes three flavors, Avacado, Blueberry and Chocolate.  A batch of Avacdo requires 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk and 2 cups of cream.  A batch of blueberry Blueberry requires 1 egg, 1 cup of milk and 2 cups of cream.  A batch of Chocolate requires 1 egg, 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of cream.  The manufacturer has 350 eggs, 350 cups of milk, and 400 cups of cream.  How many batches of each flavor should be made to use up all of the ingredients?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let us suppose that <m>a</m> represents the number of Avacado batches, <m>b</m> blueberry and <m>c</m> chocolate (wildly creative of us).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the amount of eggs used is: 2 per avacado batch, 1 per blueberry and 1 per chocolate.  If we use 350 eggs, this gives us: <me>2a+b+c=350.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of milk used is: 1 cup per avacado batch, 1 per blueberry and 2 per chocolate.  If we use 350 cups of milk, this gives us: <me>a+b+2c=350.</me>
        </p>  
        <p>
          The amount of cream used is: 2 cups per avacado batch, 2 per blueberry and 1 per chocolate.  If we use 400 cups of cream, this gives us: <me>2a+2b+c=350.</me>
        </p>  

        <p>
          Putting all this together gives us:
          <md>
          <mrow>2a+b+c \amp=350</mrow>
          <mrow>a+b+2c \amp=350</mrow>
          <mrow>2a+2b+c \amp=400</mrow>
        </md>
        Which has matrix form:
        <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 
                  2 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  350\\ 
                  1 \amp  1 \amp  2 \amp  350\\ 
                  2 \amp  2 \amp  1 \amp  400 \end{array} \right)
                </me>

         Which in turn has reduced row echelon form:
        <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 
                  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  100\\ 
                  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  50\\ 
                  0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  100 \end{array} \right)
                </me>       
         </p>
         <p>
          So 100 batches of Avacado, 50 batches of Blueberry and 100 batches of Chocolate does the trick!
         </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          An investor purchases stocks in three different companies.  Overpriced Textbooks Inc., Sandwich Solutions and Union Holdings Inc..  Their prices and dividend yields are as follows:

          <me>
            \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            \text{Company} \amp \text{Price} \amp \text{Dividend Yield}\\
            \hline
            \text{Overpriced Textbooks Inc.} \amp \$56 \amp 2\%\\
            \text{Sandwich Solutions} \amp \$16 \amp 7\%\\
            \text{Union Holdings Inc.} \amp \$80 \amp 2\%\\
            \hline
            \end{array}
          </me>
          </p>
          <p>

            
            She invested a total of $8,400 in shares of the three
stocks at the given prices and expected to earn $248 in
annual dividends. If she purchased a total of 200 shares,
how many shares of each stock did she purchase?


          </p>  
          </statement>  

          <solution>
            <p>
            Let  <m>o, s, u</m> represent the number of shares in Overpriced Textbooks Inc., Sandwich Solutions and Union Holdings Inc. respectively.
          </p>

            <p>
              Notice that she pays $56 per share of Overpriced Textbooks Inc., $16 per share of Sandwich Solutions and $80 per share of Union Holdings Inc..  So if this totals $8400, then: <me>56o+16s+80u=8400.</me>
            </p>  

            <p>
              Then note: each share of Overpriced Textbooks Inc. pays <m>56\cdot 0.02=1.12</m> in dividends, a share of Sandwich Solutions pays <m>16\cdot 0.07=1.12</m> in dividends and each share of Union Holdings Inc. pays <m>80\cdot 0.02=1.60</m> in dividends.  So if this totals $248, then: <me>1.12o+1.12s+1.6u=248.</me>
            </p> 
            <p>
              Finally,she bought 200 shares, so <me>o+s+u=200.</me>
            </p>  

            <p>
          Putting all this together gives us:
          <md>
          <mrow>56o+16s+80u\amp=8400</mrow>
          <mrow>1.12o+1.12s+1.6u\amp=248</mrow>
          <mrow>o+s+u\amp=200</mrow>
        </md>
        Which has matrix form:
        <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 
                  56 \amp  16 \amp  80 \amp  8400\\ 
                  1.12 \amp  1.12 \amp  1.6 \amp  248\\ 
                  1 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  200 \end{array} \right)
                </me>

         Which in turn has reduced row echelon form:
        <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 
                  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  50\\ 
                  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  100\\ 
                  0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  50 \end{array} \right)
                </me> 
                So 50 shares of Overpriced Textbooks Inc., 100 shares of Sandwich Solutions and 50 shares of Union Holdings Inc.     
         </p>
          </solution>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A company is using trucks vans and SUV's to ship prototype robots.  There are three models: A, B and C. A truck holds 2 model A's, 2 model B's and 1 model C.  A van holds 3 A's, 2B's, 3 C's.  A SUV holds 5A's, 6B's and 2C's.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              How many trucks, vans and SUV's would you need to ship 42 model A's, 40 model B's, and 26 model C's.
             </li>
             <li>
             How many of each type of vehicles could you use if model C's were discontinued?
           </li>
         </ol>


        </p>  
      </statement>   

      <solution>
        <p>
        Let's let <m>t</m> be the number of trucks, <m>v</m> the number of vans and <m>s</m> be the number of SUV's. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each truck holds 2 model A's, each van 3, and each SUV 3.  Since 28 model A's are shipped, this is results in <me>2t+3v+5s=42.</me>
      </p>  

      <p>
        Each truck holds 2 model B's, each van 2, and each SUV 6.  Since 30 model B's are shipped, this is results in <me>2t+2v+6s=40.</me>
      </p>  

      x<p>
        Each truck holds 1 model C, each van 3, and each SUV 2.  Since 16 model C's are shipped, this is results in <me>t+3v+2s=26.</me>
      </p>  
      <p>
      Putting all this together gives us:
          <md>
          <mrow>2t+3v+5s\amp =42</mrow>
          <mrow>2t+2v+6s \amp =40</mrow>
          <mrow>t+3v+2s \amp=26</mrow>
        </md>
        Which has matrix form:
        <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 
                  2 \amp  3 \amp  5 \amp  42\\ 
                  2 \amp  2 \amp  6 \amp  40\\ 
                  1 \amp  3 \amp  2 \amp  26 \end{array} \right)
                </me>

         Which in turn has reduced row echelon form:
        <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 
                  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  10\\ 
                  0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  4\\ 
                  0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  2 \end{array} \right)
                </me> 
                So 10 trucks, 4 vans and 2 SUV's.     
         </p>

    </solution>

    <solution>
      <p>
        If we remove the model C requirement, we have the system:
          <md>
          <mrow>2t+3v+5s\amp =42</mrow>
          <mrow>2t+2v+6s \amp =40</mrow>
        </md>
        Which in turn has reduced row echelon form:
        <me>
                  \left( \begin{array}{rrr|r} 
                  1 \amp  0 \amp  4 \amp  18\\ 
                  0 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  2\\ 
                  \end{array} \right)
                </me> 

        In other words:  
        <md>
          <mrow>t+4s\amp =18</mrow>
          <mrow> v-s\amp =2</mrow>
        </md>      

      </p>

      <p>
        So there is more than 1 solution.  Remember that the number of any type of vehicle has to be a non-negative whole number. 
        <ol>

        <li> So if you had <m>s=0</m> SUV's, then you must have <m>t=18-4\cdot 0=18</m> trucks and <m>v=2+0=2</m> vans. </li> 
        <li> If you had <m>s=1</m> SUV's, then you must have <m>t=18-4\cdot 1=14</m> trucks and <m>v=2+1=3</m> vans. </li>
        <li> If you had <m>s=2</m> SUV's, then you must have <m>t=18-4\cdot 2=10</m> trucks and <m>v=2+2=4</m> vans. </li>
        <li> If you had <m>s=3</m> SUV's, then you must have <m>t=18-4\cdot 3=6</m> trucks and <m>v=2+3=5</m> vans. </li>
        <li> If you had <m>s=4</m> SUV's, then you must have <m>t=18-4\cdot 4=2</m> trucks and <m>v=2+4=6</m> vans. </li>
        <li> If you had <m>s=5</m> SUV's, then you must have <m>t=18-4\cdot 5=-2</m> trucks which is impossible.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>  

      <p>
        So the valid number of truck, van and SUV's are: <m>(18,2,0), (14,3,1), (10,4,2), (6,5,3), (2,6,4).</m>
      </p>  
    </solution>
