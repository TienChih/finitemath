  <introduction>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Up to this point, we have mostly focused on the probability of specific events. In this section, we take a step back and look at the experiment itself.  Certainly, if I have a jar with 5 red and 7 blue balls and draw 3 without replacement, there is a chance that I get 2 red balls.  But now we want to ask, what number of red balls are more or less likely?  On average, how many red balls would I get?  How varied are the results?

    <title>Random Variables </title>
  
    <definition xml:id="DefinitionRandomVariable">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>random variable</term> is a function that assigns a real number to each element of the sample space.
        </p>
      </statement>
   </definition> 

  <example>
    <title>Rolling two dice</title>
   <statement>
   <p>
   Consider the experiment rolling two dice.  We can see that the sample space for this experiment is:
   <me>(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6)</me>
    <me>(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6)</me>
    <me>(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)</me>
    <me>(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6)</me>
    <me>(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(5,6)</me>
    <me>(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6)</me>
  </p>
  <p>

    So if we consider the random variable <m>X</m> to be <q>sum of die outcomes</q>, we would have the assignment:

    <me>2,3,4,5,6,7</me><me>3,4,5,6,7,8</me><me>4,5,6,7,8,9</me><me>5,6,7,8,9,10</me><me>6,7,8,9,10,11</me><me>7,8,9,10,11,12</me></p>

    <p>

    On the other hand, if the random variable <m>Y</m> to be <q>second die outcome</q>, we would have the assignment:

    <me>1,2,3,4,5,6</me><me>1,2,3,4,5,6</me><me>1,2,3,4,5,6</me><me>1,2,3,4,5,6</me><me>1,2,3,4,5,6</me><me>1,2,3,4,5,6</me></p>

    <p>

    There are many more possibilities of course, but one last one, if <m>Z</m> denoted <q>larger of die rolls</q> we would have:

    <me>1,2,3,4,5,6</me> <me>2,2,3,4,5,6</me> <me>3,3,3,4,5,6</me> <me>4,4,4,4,5,6</me> <me>5,5,5,5,5,6</me> <me>6,6,6,6,6,6</me>
  </p>
  </statement>
  </example>

<p>
A <term>probability distribution</term> is, roughly speaking, a complete description of a random variable and the likelihood of each output.  In the case of random variables with a finite number of possible outputs a <term>probability distribution table</term> is a convenient way of presenting this information.
</p>

<p>
  So let <m>X</m> denote <q>the outcome of a die roll</q>.  We have that <m>X</m> could take on the values <m>1,\ldots, 6</m> and for each of these values, say <m>1</m>, the probability <m>X=1</m> is <m>P(X=1)=\frac{1}{6}</m>.  This gives us:

  <me>
  \begin{array}{|c|cccccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6}\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
</me>
</p>  

<p>
  What does this mean concretely?  It means that if one were to roll a dice <m>n</m> times, we would expect about a sixth of the outcomes to correspond to each of the numbers 1 through 6.  See the interaction below, hit the refresh on the top left.
  <interactive desmos="ewkox50rsz"/>
</p>  




<remark>
  <statement>
    <p>
      To check if something is a valid probability distribution, for any possible outcome <m>x</m> of <m>X</m> we must have:
      <ul>
        <li><m>0\leq P(X=x)\leq1</m>.  This ensures all outcomes are valid probabilities.</li>
        <li><m>\sum P(X=x)=1</m>.  The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes should be 100% of the outcomes</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
 </statement>

<example xml:id="ExampleTicket">
  <title>Lottery tickets</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
  Suppose you buy a ticket for a game of chance.  You have a <m>1/10</m> chance of winning the grand prize <m>\$20</m> and a <m>3/10</m> chance of winning the runner up prize <m>\$5</m>. Find a probability distribution for <m>X</m> your winnings.  What is the probability you win something?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
  The chance you win nothing would be <m>1-\frac{1}{10}-\frac{3}{10}=\frac{6}{10}</m>.  So the probability distribution would be:
  <me>
  \begin{array}{|c|ccc|}

  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{6}{10} \amp \frac{3}{10} \amp \frac{1}{10} \\

<example xml:id="ExampleApple">
  <title>Poisoned apples</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
  Snow white has a basket of 10 apples, 3 are poisened.  She is going to pick 4 apples at random to eat for some reason.  let <m>X</m> denote the number of poisened apples she eats.  Find a probability distribution for <m>X</m>.  What's the probability she eats at least 2 poisened apples?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
  There are 3 poisened apples and 7 non-poisened apples.  Each selection ensures she is picking some number of poisened and the rest non poisened.  She can't pick more than 3 poisened apples since that's all there is.  So the probability distribution would be:
  <me>
  \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{C(3,0)C(7,4)}{C(10,4)} \amp \frac{C(3,1)C(7,3)}{C(10,4)} \amp \frac{C(3,2)C(7,2)}{C(10,4)} \amp \frac{C(3,3)C(7,1)}{C(10,4)}\\

<subsection>
  <title>Expectation, Variance and Standard Deviation</title>

  <p> Revsiting the dice example above, whats the mean of our 100 die rolls?  As I repeat this, does it change much?
    <interactive desmos="gwx0h7ruep"/>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can see that repeatng the experiment more or less gives us an average outcome of about mid 3-something, we should also see that the <q>spread</q> of the outcomes (the standard deviation and variance) also doesn't change much either.  If we look at <xref ref="ExampleTicket"/>, we can see the same happens here.
    <interactive desmos="u0pvqppiic"/>
  </p>
  
  <definition xml:id="DefinitionExpectation">
    <p>
  Given a finite random variable  <m>X</m>, it's <term>expected value</term> is the predicted average outcome of experiments, and is computed: <me>E(X)=\sum P(X=x)\cdot x.</me>
</p>
<p>
  We think of this as the outcomes of <m>X</m>, weighted by their likelihood, so the more likely outcomes contribute more than the less likely ones.
</p>  
<p>
  Note that the <q>Expected Value</q> may not be a value we actually expect, that is, may not be one of the outcomes, just an average outcome.
</p>  
</definition>

<p>
  So in our die rolling case, the expected average outcome would be computed: <me>E(X)=\frac{1}{6}\cdot 1+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 2+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 3+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 4+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 5+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 6=\frac{21}{6}=3.5.</me>
</p>  

<definition xml:id="DefinitionVarSTD">
    <p>
  Given a finite random variable  <m>X</m>, it's <term>variance</term> is a measure of the <q>spread</q> or variation of the outcomes, and is computed: <me>Var(X)=E(X^2)-E(X).</me>
</p>
<p>The <term>standard deviation</term> is the square root of the variance, denoted <m>\sigma_X</m>.</p>
<p>
  The difference between standard deviation and variance, and the exact things they measure, are somehwat beyond the scope of this text.  The best way to think of the variance computation, is as a way of measuring expected distance of outcomes from the mean.
</p>  
</definition>

<p>
  So in our die rolling case, we already have <m>E(X)=3.5</m>, we then compute: <me>E(X^2)=\frac{1}{6}\cdot 1^2+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 2^2+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 3^2+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 4^2+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 5^2+\frac{1}{6}\cdot 6^2=\frac{91}{6}.</me>  So we  have the variance of <m>X</m>: <me>Var(X)=\frac{91}{6}-(3.5)^2=\frac{35}{12}\approx 2.91667.</me>  Finally the standard deviation of <m>X</m>: <me>\sigma_X=\sqrt{\frac{35}{12}}\approx 1.7078.</me>
</p>

<p>
As usual, menial computation is for machines:
<interactive desmos="00ih4xhxdz"/>
</p>  


<p>  We can use sagecells and R to simulate these outcomes.  We let <m>n</m> denote the number of trials, <m>X</m> the outcomes, and <m>p</m> their probabilities.  The histogram of outcomes, mean, variance and standard deviations are displayed below:
</p>
<sage language="r">
        <input>
n&lt;-1500
X&lt;-c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
prob&lt;-c(1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6)
Results&lt;-sample(X,n,replace=TRUE, prob)

hist(Results)

print(mean(Results))
print(var(Results))

<example>
<title>Break-even point on Lottery Tickets</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
  Recall <xref ref="ExampleTicket"/>.  How much should the ticket cost so the game breaks even on average?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
  We first need to know the expected winnings, if we recall the probability dstrbution:
  <me>
  \begin{array}{|c|ccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp 0 \amp 5 \amp 20 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{6}{10} \amp \frac{3}{10} \amp \frac{1}{10} \\
  \hline
  \end{array}
</me>
</p>
<p>
We have <m>E(X)=0\cdot(0.6)+5\cdot(0.3)+20\cdot(0.1)=3.5</m>.  So the game returns <m>\$3.50</m> on average, so charging <m>\$3.50</m> would make it break even.
<interactive desmos="9affco9har"/>

<example>
<title>Expectation and Variance of Poisoned Apples</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
  Recall <xref ref="ExampleApple"/>.  What is the expected value and variance of poisened apples.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
  Recall the probability distribution of poisened apples.

<me>
  \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{35}{210}\approx 0.1667\amp \frac{105}{210}=0.5 \amp \frac{63}{210}=0.3 \amp \frac{7}{210}\approx 0.0333\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
</me>

So the expected value of poisened apples would be <me>E(X)=0\cdot\frac{35}{210}+1\cdot\frac{=105}{210}+2\cdot\frac{63}{210}+3\cdot\frac{7}{210}=1.2.</me>
</p>
<p>
  Then <me>E(X^2)=0^2\cdot\frac{35}{210}+1^2\cdot\frac{=105}{210}+2^2\cdot\frac{63}{210}+3^3\cdot\frac{7}{210}=2.</me> So <me>Var(X)=E(X^2)-E(X)^2=2-1.2^2=0.56.</me>
  Which may also be computed:

    <li>Find <m>\sigma_X</m>.</li>

<solution>
  <p>
  So there are 3 defective and 17 non-defective products.

  <ol>
    <li>We note that each selection comes from either defective or non-defective products.  So:

  \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}

  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{C(3,0)C(17,5)}{C(20,5)}\amp \frac{C(3,1)C(17,4)}{C(20,5)} \amp \frac{C(3,2)C(17,3)}{C(20,5)} \amp \frac{C(3,3)C(17,2)}{C(20,5)}\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
</me>

This may be rewritten
<me>
  \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}

  P(X=x) \amp \frac{6188}{15504}\amp \frac{7140}{15504} \amp \frac{2040}{15504} \amp \frac{136}{15504}\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
</me>
    </li>
    <li>This would be computed: <me>E(X)=0\cdot\frac{6188}{15504}+1\cdot\frac{7140}{15504}+2\cdot\frac{2040}{15504}+3\cdot\frac{136}{15504}=0.75.</me></li>
    <li>We first note:
      <me>E(X^2)=0^2\cdot\frac{6188}{15504}+1^2\cdot\frac{7140}{15504}+2^2\cdot\frac{2040}{15504}+3^2\cdot\frac{136}{15504}=\frac{81}{76}\approx 1.0658.</me>  This leads:
      <me>Var(X)=E(X^2)-E(X)^2=\frac{81}{76}-0.75^2=\frac{153}{304}\approx0.5033.</me> Finally:
      <me>\sigma_X=\sqrt{Var(X)}=\sqrt{\frac{153}{304}}\approx 0.7094.</me>

  An insurance policy on an electrical device
pays a benefit of <m>\$3000</m> if the device fails during the first year.
The amount of the benefit decreases by <m>\$1000</m> each successive

of any given year, the probability of failure during that year
is 0.3. What is the expected benefit under this policy?


</p>

<solution>
  <p>
  We note that the device has a <m>0.3</m> chance to fail in the first year, <m>(0.7)(0.3)</m> chance to fail the second since it had to survive the first, <m>(0.7)^2(0.3)</m> to fail the third year, after which the policy ends.  So if <m>X</m> is the payout, then it has distribution

<me>
  \begin{array}{|c|cccc|}

  P(X=x) \amp (0.3) \amp (0.7)(0.3) \amp (0.7)^2(0.3) \amp 1-(0.3)-(0.7)(0.3)-(0.7)^2(0.3)\\

Which has expected value <me>E(x)=3000\cdot0.3+2000\cdot0.21+1000\cdot0.147+0\cdot0.343=1467.</me>
