    <title>Form of Quadratic functions</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>q(x)</m> is a <term> quadratic function</term> if it may be written as:
          <me>
            q(x)=ax^2+bx+c
          </me>.
          where <m>a\neq0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The classic example is the standard parabola,
      <m>y=x^2</m> or a quadratic with
      <m>a=1.</m> <m> b,c=0</m>. 

      <interactive desmos="aktz8g8cbh"  />

      We should be familiar with some of the properties of this shape,
      it's symmetric on both sides and it goes to positive infinity in both directions
      (as <m>x^2</m> cannot be negative).
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be nice if we could show that all quadratics had the same essential shape.
      To do this, we must first show that all quadratics also have the form
      <me>
        q(x)=a(x-h)^2+k
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see this:</p>

  <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>q(x)\amp = ax^2+bx+c</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = a\left(x^2+\frac{b}{a}x\right)+c</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = a\left(x^2+2\frac{b}{2a}x+\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right)+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So by letting <m>h=-\frac{b}{2a}</m> and <m>k=c-\frac{b^2}{4a}</m>,
      we have our form.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting byproduct of this is that if we were to solve <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>,
      we would get:
      <md>
        <mrow>ax^2+bx+c\amp = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}\amp = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2\amp=\frac{b^2}{4a}-c</mrow>
        <mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2\amp=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a}</mrow>
        <mrow>(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2\amp=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>x+\frac{b}{2a}\amp=\frac{\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
        <mrow>x\amp =\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is the <term>quadratic formula</term>.

    <title>Parabolas</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have this form
      <m>a(x-h)^2+k</m>, consider how <m>a,h</m>,
      and <m>k</m> affect the shape of the graph: 

      <interactive desmos="21eduimmih"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sliding <m>k</m> shifts the parabola up and down.
      We can think of this as adding to or detracting from the value of <m>x^2</m>.
      Sliding <m>h</m> shifts the graph left and right.
      We can think of this as slowing down or speeding up <m>x^2</m> by <m>h</m> units.
      <m>a</m> stretches or squashes <m>x^2</m>,
      or if <m>a</m> is negative, also reflects this across the <m>x</m> axis.
      But all of these transformations preserve the fundamental shape of a parabola,
      so all quadratic functions have this shape.
    </p>
    <p> Note that since <m>ax^2+bx+c= a(x-h)^2+k</m> is a shift of the standard parabola by <m>h</m> and <m>k</m>, we have that the <term> vertex </term> of <m>y=ax^2+bx+c</m> the maximum or minimum value, is the point <m>(h,k)=(-\frac{b}{2a}, c-\frac{b^2}{4a})</m>.
    <interactive desmos="dkk6wlkmzz"  />
  </p>

  <p>
    A less computationally intense way of finding the vertex is to see where the roots of the quadratic are, that is, where the parabola has <m>x</m>-intercepts.  Due to the symmetry of a parabola, the vertex must occur halfway in between.</p>

   <p>
   If we consider the parabola <m>y=x(20-x)</m>  the roots occur at <m>x=0, 10</m> , the the <m>x</m> value of the vertex is halfway between these points at <m>x=10</m>, and the <m>y</m> value is <m>(10,(20-10)=100</m>.

   <interactive desmos="efnmxzpiuk" />

   One could rewrite <m>y=-x^2+20x+0</m> and find the vertex that way as well.

      <title>Maximizing revenue</title>
  <statement>
<p> Suppose that in an apartment complex of 80 units, if the rent is <m>\$800 </m> a month, all the units will be filled.  For every <m>\$25</m> we increase the rent there will be an additional vacancy.  What rent maximizes the monthly revenue?
    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
<p> We note that the monthly revenue generated by the apartment complex is <m>O\cdot T</m> where <m>O</m> is the occupancy and <m>T</m> is the rent (the rent per unit, times the number of units rented).</p><p>  We note that if <m>x</m> is the amount in dollars <em>above</em>  <m>\$800</m> that you charge, then <m>O=80-\frac{x}{25}</m>, that is, occupancy starts at 80 and decreases one per <m>\$25</m>.  On the other hand, the rent <m>T=800+x</m>.  So <m>R(x)=(80-\frac{x}{25})(800+x)=-\frac{1}{25}x^2+48x+64000</m>. </p><p> So our vertex occurs at <m>h=-\frac{48}{2\cdot \frac{-1}{25}}=600</m> and <m>k=64000-\frac{48^2}{4\cdot \frac{-1}{25}}=78400</m>. </p><p> Since this <m>h=600</m> is how much the rent is increased, the revenue is maximized when the rent is <m>800+600=\$1400</m> a month, with an occupancy of <m>80-\frac{600}{25}=56</m> units, for a total revenue of <m>\$78400</m>.

  <title>Maximizing Area</title>
  <statement>
<p> Suppose that you were given 200 ft of fencing to fence in a rectangular area.  What is the largest are you could fence in and what would it's dimensions be?
    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
<p> We note that a rectangle has length sides and two width sides.  If <m>\ell </m> is the length of the length sides and <m>w</m> the width side, we obtain: <me>2\ell+2w=200</me> or <m>\ell+w=100</m>.  We also have that the area of a rectangle is <m>A=\ell w</m>.  Thus:

<md>
        <mrow>A\amp = \ell w</mrow>
        <mrow>A\amp = (100-w)w</mrow>
        <mrow>A\amp = -w^2+100w.</mrow>
      </md>
      Thus the fenced region has area 0 when <m>w=0,100</m>  the vertex must occur halfway in between at <m>w=50, \ell=100-50=50, A=50\cdot 50=2500</m> square feet.

  <title>Selling Widgets</title>
  <statement>
<p> A company sells widgets for <m>\$50</m> each.  Unfortunately, no one wants to buy them.  The discover that for each dollar they lower the price, 5 more people are willing to buy a widget.  The marginal cost of producing a widget is <m>\$10</m> with fixed cost <m>\$300</m>.  How should the widget be priced to maximize profit?  What is this profit, and how many widgets would be sold?
    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
<p> Let's let<m>x</m> denote the value by which we decrease the price of a widget from <m>\$50</m>.  We'll note that the quantity sold is <m>q=5x</m>.  From this we deduce:

  <ul>
    <li>The revenue is the price of a widget, times the number sold.  So <m>R(x)=(50-x)q=(50-x)5x</m>.</li>
    <li>The cost is the fixed cost of <m>\$300</m>, plus the marginal cost <m>\$10</m> times the number sold.  So <m>RCx)=300+10q=300+10(5x)=300+50x</m>.</li>
    <li>The profit is revenue minus cost.  So <m>P(x)=R(x)-C(x)=(50-x)5x-(300+50x)=-5x^2+200x-300</m>.</li>


  </ul>  

  <interactive desmos="zeash75ef0" />

  Which by whatever method you most prefer, has vertex <m>(20,1700)</m>.  So the profit is maximized when the price is reduced by <m>\$20</m> or when the price is <m>p=\$30</m>.  The profit here would be <m>\$1700</m> with <m>20\cdot5=100</m> widgets sold.
