  <title> Normal Distributions</title>
  <introduction>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In this section, we study one of the most ubiquitous and fundamental probability distributions in nature and mathematics: the <term>normal distribution</term>.  We may know this as the standard <q> bell curve</q>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </introduction>      

  <subsection>
    <title>The standard Normal Curve </title>
  
    <definition>
      <p>
        The <term>standard normal curve</term> is the curve generated by <me>y=\frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}.</me>
        This may be seen below.
        <interactive desmos="5glqmgffkg"/>
      </p>
   </definition>     

   <p>We observe some things about this curve:
    <ul>
      <li> The peak of this curve is at <m>x=0</m></li>
      <li> The curve is symmetric, it's behavior on the one side mirrors that of the other.</li>
      <li> It's values are largest the closer the <m>x</m> values are to zero.</li>
      <li>The bulk of the area under the curve falls between -3 and 3, and otherwise tapers off as <m>x</m> approaches <m>\infty, -\infty</m>.</li>
   </ul>
   These are all things we would intuitively associate with a bell curve.
   </p>

   <remark>
   <p>
   The standard normal curve is the probability distribution of the <term>standard normal distribution</term>, the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  For <em>continuous distributions</em> such as the normal distribution, we can have valid values that are any real number, as opposed to a finite or countable list.  Consequently we compute probabilities by finding <em>areas</em> under this curve.
 </p>

 <p>
  We use <m>Z</m> to denote the standard normal random variable, the probability that <m>Z</m> is between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is the area under the normal curve between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
 </p>
</remark>

<p>
  Finding these values is generally done through machine-assisted computations.  Many texts use a <m>z</m>-score table presentation where values of <m>z</m> and associated probabilities are listed.  However, these are just values computed by machines listed on paper.  This made sense in a day and age were computing power wasn't universal.  If you're reading this, this is clearly no longer the case.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So if we wanted to find say <m>P(-1.2\lt Z\leq 2)</m>  this could be done as follows:
  <interactive desmos="8m5mr0vq9c"/>
  This is the standard curve so the mean <m>\mu=0</m> and the standard deviation <m>\sigma=1</m>.  The bounds of our region are <m>a=-1.2, b=2</m> respectively.  So <m>P(-1.2\lt z\leq 2)\approx0.8622.</m>
 </p> 

 <p>
  By typing <q>infinity</q> into the bounds, we can also find the areas of unbounded regions.  If we wanted to find say <m>P(z>1.5)</m>, this is equivalent to <m>P(1.5\lt z\lt \infty)</m>. Thus <m>P(Z>1.5)\approx 0.0668</m>.
  </p> 
 
    <p>
      Using desmos:
      <interactive desmos="r099v73buw"/>
    </p>
     

 

 <p>
  We can turn this around and say, given a probabibility or area, to find an appropriate bound.  Suppose we wanted to find a <m>k</m> so that <m>P(Z\lt k)=0.4</m>.  So note that each <m>k</m> yields a different probability:
  <interactive desmos="16iyumeumv"/>
 </p> 

<p>
  We can see that we get to <m>P=0.4</m> fairly close to 0, on the negative side.  Specifically around <m>k\approx-0.2533</m>.
  <interactive desmos="ktkeqhrr7c"/>

  <title>Some things to keep in mind</title>
   <p>
   Here are some quick facts and heuristics about the normal curve to give you an intuitive sense on how it behaves.
   <ul>
      <li> Each half is 50% of the curve, so have greater than the mean, half less than the mean.</li>
      <li> For any tail of the distribution, the corresponding tail on the other side has the same area.</li>
      <li> Roughly 67% of the curve lies within <m>\pm 1</m> standard deviations from the mean,  95% within <m>\pm 2</m> standard deviations from the mean, and 99.7% within <m>\pm 3</m> standard deviations from the mean.</li>
   </ul>
 </p>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Find the following for the standard normal distribution.
      <ol>
        <li><m>P(-2\lt Z\lt 1.8)</m></li>
        <li><m>P(Z\lt 0.76)</m></li>
        <li><m>z_0</m> such that <m>P(Z\lt z_0)=0.67</m></li>
        <li><m>P(Z> -1.1)</m></li>
        <li><m>z_0</m> such that <m>P(Z> z_0)=0.22</m></li>
        <li><m>z_0</m> such that <m>P(-z_0\lt Z\lt z_0)=0.8</m></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
   </statement>
   <solution>
    <p>
      We are given bounds and asked to find a probability, so: <m>P(-2\lt Z\lt 1.8)\approx 0.9413</m>
      <interactive desmos="j3odyygiqs"/>
     </p> 
   </solution> 
   <solution>
    <p>
      We are given bounds and asked to find a probability, so: <m>P( Z\lt 0.76)\approx 0.7764</m>
      <interactive desmos="mdylpq4kf6"/>
     </p> 
   </solution>
   <solution>
    <p>
      We are given a probability and asked to find a bound, so: <m>P(Z\lt z_0)=0.67</m> is satisfied when <m>z_0\approx 0.4399</m>
      <interactive desmos="seaxnuolrg"/>
      Note that we could also note that this <m>z_0</m> must satisfy <m>P(Z>z_0)=0.33</m>:
      <interactive desmos="zu3pxbd0ah"/>
      Which yields the same <m>z_0\approx 0.4399</m>.
     </p> 
   </solution>

   <solution>
    <p>
      We are given bounds and asked to find a probability, so: <m>P(Z> -1.1)\approx0.8643</m>
      <interactive desmos="llig7fnfhd"/>
     </p> 
   </solution>

   <solution>
    <p>
      We are given a probability and asked to find a bound, so: <m>P(Z> z_0)=0.22</m> is satisfied when <m>z_0\approx 0.47722</m>
      <interactive desmos="i2xa3ajuqp"/>
      Note that we could also note that this <m>z_0</m> must satisfy <m>P(Z\lt z_0)=0.78</m>:
      <interactive desmos="jny1wlshet"/>
      Which yields the same <m>z_0\approx 0.7722</m>.
     </p> 
   </solution>

   <solution>
    <p>
      We are given a probability and asked to find a bound.  Specifically, the bounds of a region that is symmetric about the mean, the same distance to the left as to the right.  So: <m>P(-z_0\lt Z\lt z_0)=0.8</m> is satisfied when <m>z_0\approx 1.2816</m>
      <interactive desmos="7shbr2wz76"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that since 80% of the area falls in this central region, the sum of the tails must be 20%, and since the tails are mirror images of each other, each tail must contain 10%. Thus <m>z_0</m> must satisfy <m>P(Z\lt -z_0)=0.10</m>:
      <interactive desmos="tsfvtn8fal"/>
      Which yields <m>-z_0\approx -1.2816</m> so the same <m>z_0\approx 1.2816</m>.  We could also approach this from the right:
      <interactive desmos="lkdrpqtqp8"/>

<subsection>
  <title>General Normal Distributions</title>

  <p>  The fact is, most things we care about in the real world don't happen to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  So we introduce the notion of <m>general normal distributions</m>.  Things that are generally normally distributed may have any mean and standard deviation, but what makes them normally distributed is that they have the <em>same fundamental shape</em> as the standard normal, a bell curved symmetric shape.  In the standard normal curve, the standard deviation is 1, so the units of <m>z</m> are standard deviations.  We can translate values from any <m>X</m> normally distributed random variable to the standard distribution through <term><m>z</m>-scores</term>.
</p>

<definition>
  <p>
  Given a normally distributed variable <m>X</m> with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>, the <term><m>z</m>-score</term> of a value <m>x</m> of <m>X</m> is the number of standard deviations <m>x</m> is above or below the mean.  This is computed <me>z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}.</me>
</p>
</definition>

<p>
  So if we had a normally distributed variable <m>X</m> with <m>\mu=10, \sigma=3</m>, if we wanted to find <m>P(8\lt X\lt 11)</m>, we could turn this into a standard normal problem.
</p>
<p> 
  So the <m>z</m>-score of <m>8</m> would be <me>z=\frac{8-10}{3}=-\frac{2}{3}.</me>  Similarly, the <m>z</m>-score of <m>11</m> would be <me>z=\frac{11-10}{3}=\frac{1}{3}.</me>  So  <me>P(8\lt X\lt 11)=P(-\frac{2}{3}\lt Z\lt \frac{1}{3}).</me> See below:
  <interactive desmos="0znk7lhy30"/>
  Play around with shifting <m>m,s,a,b</m> to see this changing relationship between <m>X</m> and <m>Z</m>!
</p>

<p>We can compute this problem either way, through <m>P(-\frac{2}{3}\lt Z\lt \frac{1}{3})\approx 0.3781</m>:
<interactive desmos="pl4sj2nhnt"/>
Or more directly <m>P(8\lt X\lt 11)\approx 0.3781</m>:
<interactive desmos="8ed9lkpchy"/>
Scrolling down the left side, we can see the <m>z</m>-scores are computed automatically.

<example>
  <title>Normal distribution and Tuna Weight</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose Ahi tuna weights are normally distributed with mean 120 lbs and standard deviation 25 lb's.  Kyle the fisherman goes out fishing.
      <ol>
        <li>What is the probability that a tuna he catches weighs over 150 lbs?</li>
        <li>What is the probability that a tuna he catches weighs between 50 and 100 lbs?</li>
        <li>Out of all the tuna Kyle catches, find a cutoff weight for the smallest 15%</li>
        <li>Find a <m>k</m> so that 75% of the tuna caught falls between <m>120-k</m> and <m>120+k</m> pounds.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      <m>P(X>150)\approx 0.1151</m>.
      <interactive desmos="gnjqjmeecy"/>
    </p>
  </solution>

  <solution>
    <p>
      <m>P(50\leq X\leq 100)\approx 0.2093</m>.
      <interactive desmos="txlwfrvm6m"/>
    </p>
  </solution>

  <solution>
    <p>
      15% of Tuna weigh less than 94.0892.
      <interactive desmos="cqbs6z8rn2"/>
    </p>
  </solution>  

   <solution>
    <p>
      75% of Tuna weigh between 91.2412 and 148.7587 pounds.
      <interactive desmos="pvzt2lmobx"/>
      So <m>k\approx 148.7587-120=28.7587</m> or <m>k\approx 120-91.2412=28.7587</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>

      </ol>

  <solution>
    <p>
      <m>P(X>6)\approx 0.0668</m>.
