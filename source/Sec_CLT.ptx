        In this section, we unearth one of the most powerful facets of normal distributions.  Any other random variable, so long as it has a well-defined mean and standard deviation, when sampled repeatedly and averaged, will converge to a normal distribution.

    <title>A Motivating Example </title>
  
   <p>
    Recall that the probability distribution of a die roll is:
    <me>
  \begin{array}{|c|cccccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{1}{6}\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
</me>
What if I rolled two die and took their average?  One can check that the distribution would be:
<me>
  \begin{array}{|c|ccccccccccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp 1 \amp 1.5 \amp 2 \amp 2.5 \amp 3 \amp 3.5 \amp 4 \amp 4.5 \amp 5 \amp 5.5 \amp 6 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{1}{12} \amp \frac{2}{12} \amp \frac{3}{12} \amp \frac{4}{12} \amp \frac{5}{12} \amp \frac{6}{12} \amp \frac{5}{12} \amp \frac{4}{12} \amp \frac{3}{12} \amp \frac{2}{12} \amp \frac{1}{12}\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
</me>
We notice some things.  First, the distribution is no longer uniform, the central values are more likely than the extreme values.  Realted to that, there is consequently less variation in results, as central values become more likely.
   </p>

   <p>
    What happens as wel roll 3 dice and average the result, 4?  20?  Rather than compute all these distributions, let's simulate the results:
    <interactive desmos="77ouws7sar"/>
  As <m>n</m> grows, we should notice two things:
  <ul>
    <li>The  values generated by  rolling <m>n</m> dice and averaging them are less varied as <m>n</m> increases.</li>
    <li> As <m>n</m> increases, the distribution of these averages more closely resembles a <em>normal distribution</em>.</li>
 </ul>   
   </p>

  <title>The Central Limit Theorem</title>

  <theorem xml:id="TheoremCLT">
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be any random variable with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>.  Let <m>X_n</m> be the random variable generated by sampling <m>X</m> <m>n</m> times and averaging the results.  Then, as <m>n</m> gets sufficiently large, <m>X_n</m> may be approximated by a normal random variable woth parameters:
      <ul>
        <li> Mean <m>\mu_n=\mu</m>.</li>
        <li> Standard deviation <m>\sigma_n=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.</li>
      </ul>

    </p>  
  </theorem>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Usually, we let <m>n\geq 30</m> as <q>big enough</q> for the Central Limit Theorem to activate, but this is a heuristic.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
  We can see this in action with die rolls above, but let's say that you have a game of chance.  Tickets cost <m>\$2</m>.  You have a 3 in 10 chance of winning <m>\$5</m> and a 1 in 10 chance of winning <m>\$10</m>.  The <em>net</em> winnings have the following distribution:
    <me>
  \begin{array}{|c|ccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp -2 \amp 3 \amp 8 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{6}{10} \amp \frac{3}{10} \amp \frac{1}{10}\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
  </me>
  So one could ask, what is the average net winnings if you buy <m>n</m> tickets?  The outcomes would be distributed as follows:
  <interactive desmos="lrk2echwyr"/>
</p>

<example>
  <title>Winnings of mass-purchased Lottery Tickets</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you have a game of chance.  Tickets cost <m>\$2</m>.  You have a 3 in 10 chance of winning <m>\$5</m> and a 1 in 10 chance of winning <m>\$10</m>.  The <em>net</em> winnings have the following distribution:
    <me>
  \begin{array}{|c|ccc|}
  \hline
  x \amp -2 \amp 3 \amp 8 \\
  \hline
  P(X=x) \amp \frac{6}{10} \amp \frac{3}{10} \amp \frac{1}{10}\\
  \hline
  \end{array}
  </me>
</p>
<p>
Then:
<ol>
  <li> Find the expected value and standard deviation of the net winnings of a single ticket.</li>
  <li>  If you bought 40 tickets, what is the chance the average net winnings is positive?</li>
  <li> If you bought 100 tickets, find an interval symmetric about the mean so that 90% of the time the average net winnings falls within this interval.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>  

<solution>
  <p>
    We have the mean is <m>\mu=E(X)=0.5, \sigma \approx 3.3541</m>.
    <interactive desmos="afu1pjhwcb"/>
  </p>
</solution>

<solution>
  <p>
    We have the mean is <m>\mu_{40}=\mu=0.5, \sigma_{40}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{40}} \approx \frac{3.3541}{\sqrt{40}}\approx 0.5303.</m>.  Thus <m>P(X_{40}>0)\approx0.8271</m>
    <interactive desmos="9bsqmo0yrw"/>
  </p>
</solution>    

<solution>
  <p>
    We have the mean is <m>\mu_{100}=\mu=0.5, \sigma_{100}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} \approx \frac{3.3541}{10}\approx 0.33541.</m>.  Thus the average net winnings of 100 tickets has a 90% chance of being between <m>-\$0.05</m> and <m>\$1.05</m>.

<exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In a factory, the fabrication machines waste excess material, the amount of waste is a random variable with mean 1kg and standard deviation 0.25 kg.

<ol>
  <li>  Find the probability that 50 machines waste 55 kg in total.</li>
  <li> Find a value <m>k</m> so that 100 machines have a 80% chance of wasting less than <m>k</m> kg of material on average.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>  



<solution>
  <p>
    In order for this to occur, the machines would have to waste, on average, 1.1 kg each.  We have the mean is <m>\mu_{50}=\mu=1, \sigma_{50}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{50}} \approx \frac{0.25}{\sqrt{50}}\approx 0.0354</m>.  Thus <m>P(X_{50}>1.1)\approx0.0023</m>
    <interactive desmos="ucky6eyh1k"/>
  </p>
</solution>    

<solution>
  <p>
    We have the mean is <m>\mu_{100}=\mu=1, \sigma_{100}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} \approx \frac{0.25}{10}=0.025</m>.  Thus the average wasted material of 100 machines has a 80% chance of being less than  <m>1.021</m> kg.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose employees of a fast food chain work hours that are normally distributed with a mean of 30 hours and standard deviation of 5 hours.

<ol>
  <li>  Find the probability that one worker works more than 40 hours in a week.</li>
  <li> Find the probability that 8 workers work an average of more than 40 hours a week.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>  



<solution>
  <p>
   Since worker hours are normally distributed and we have but the one worker, their hours just have <m>\mu=30, \sigma=5</m>.  Thus <m>P(X>40)\approx0.0228</m>

  <p>
    We have the mean is <m>\mu_{8}=\mu=30, \sigma_{8}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{8}} \approx \frac{5}{\sqrt{8}}\approx 1.7678</m>.  Thus the average <m>P(X_8>40)\approx 0</m>.

      <p>
        Angeline has a music library, the average song length is 3.75 minutes with standard deviation 0.5 minutes.  

        <ol>
        <li>If she drives an hour to her parents house, and loads a random playlist of 15 songs, what's the probability her playlist is long enough?</li>
        <li> What is the probability that her 30 song playlist lasts between  90 and 120 minutes?</li> 
       </ol>

</p>
</statement>  



<solution>
  <p>
   In order for this to happen, the average song length has to be 4 minutes.  We have <m>\mu_{15}=\mu=3.75</m> and <m>\sigma_{15}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{15}}=\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{15}}\approx 0.1291</m>.  Thus <m>P(X_{15}>4)\approx0.0264</m>.
    <interactive desmos="oggp7ee6qe"/>
  </p>
</solution>    

<solution>
  <p>
   In order for this to happen, the average song length has to be between <m>\frac{90}{30}= 3</m> and <m>\frac{120}{30}=4</m> minutes.  We have <m>\mu_{30}=\mu=3.75</m> and <m>\sigma_{30}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{30}}=\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{30}}\approx 0.0913</m>.  Thus <m>P(3\leq X_{30}\leq 4)\approx0.9969</m>.

  <title>A Big Disclaimer</title>

  <p>
    A lot of our statistical techniques and analysis is predicated on the Central Limit Theorem.  It's an extremely powerful tool to use sample size to force normality and reduce variability.  But the Central Limit Theorem <em>Only applies to random variables with a defined mean and standard deviation.</em>  This does not describe every possible random variable.
  </p>
  
  <p>  Suppose you had an archer with a magic bow.  She picks an angle between 0 and <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians, and fires.  The height the arrow reaches after to travels forward for 1 foot is a random variable.  More importantly, it has no mean or variance!  This means that as we increase the sample size of random samples on this variable, there is no discernable pattern.  Desmos doesn't have the firepower to do it true justice but you can get an idea:
  <interactive desmos="inpq2hsref"/>
  Even sample sizes up to <m>n=1000</m> don't cause the mean or standard deviation to converge!
  </p>  

  <p>
    What this means is that the Central Limit Theorem won't apply to any old random variable you find lying around.  But when you collect data, it's rarely clear if the data you collect from is something with defined mean and deviation or not.  These sort of distributions often seem well behaved but are subject to high volativity that only reveals itself upon large number of data points, as seen above.  These are often dismissed as outliers!
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The bottom line is to be careful when using statistical techniques, there are dark and deep waters out here.
