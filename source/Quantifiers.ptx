  <title>Quantifiers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we introduce quantifiers.  Sometimes, we want to make statements about something always happening (Everyone who gets hurt should...).  Sometimes we want to make a statement about something that will happen but not all the time (Out of all cattle on a ranch, there will be some that...).  Sometimes we will want to combine these (For every student in the school, there will be a professor that...).  Here, we will discuss how to state such things formally.
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>For All</title>
    <p>
      Consider the statement "Every student at State U likes ice cream." How could we say that formally?

      Suppose <m>x</m> is a State U student and <m>I(x)</m> is the statement
      <q><m>x</m> likes ice cream.</q>.  Just saying <m>I(x)</m> is fine for each individual student <m>x</m>,  but our goal is to say something about <em>all</em> State U students.
      So we introduce the quantifiers <term><m>\forall</m></term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>\forall</m> is pronounced
      <q>for all</q>
      or
      <q>for every</q>, and it indicates that the  statement that follows is true for all values of <m>x</m>.
      So <m>\forall x, I(x)</m> would denote
      <q>For every State U student <m>x</m>,
      <m>x</m> likes Ice Cream.</q>. In order for a <m>\forall</m> statement to be true,
      it has to be true for <em>every</em> possible value of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, if <m>S(x)</m> is a statement about <m>x</m>, then <me> \forall x, S(x) </me> means that <m>S(x)</m> is true for every choice of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

      <title>Writing sentences as logical statements</title>
    <statement>
        <p>For each of the following sentences, write the formal accompanying statement.
          <ol>
            <li>"Every child watches YouTube."  Let <m>x</m> be a child, <m>Y(x)</m> denote "<m>x</m> watches Youtube".</li>
            <li>"Each problem has a solution."  Let <m>x</m> be a problem, <m>S(x)</m> denote "<m>x</m> has a solution".</li>
            <li>"All square numbers are non-prime."  Let <m>x</m> be a square number, <m>P(x)</m> denote "<m>x</m> is a prime".</li>
            <li>"For any integer, if it is prime, then it is either two or odd."  Let <m>x</m> be an integer, <m>P(x)</m> denote "<m>x</m> is a prime", <m>T(x)</m> denote "<m>x=2</m>", and <m>O(x)</m> denote "<m>x</m> is odd".</li>
          </ol></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Consider these statements:
          <ol>
            <li><m>\forall x, Y(x)</m>. </li>
            <li><m>\forall x, S(x)</m>. </li>
            <li><m>\forall x, \sim P(x)</m>.  </li>
            <li><m>\forall x,  P(x) \to (T(x)\vee O(x))</m>. </li>
          </ol></p>
    </solution>

    <title>Writing logical statements as sentences</title>
    <statement>
        <p>For each of the following statements, write out the sentence accompanying it.
          <ol>
            <li> <m>\forall x, M(x)</m>,  where <m>x</m> is an accordianist, <m>M(x)</m> denotes "<m>x</m> has a trained monkey".</li>
            <li> <m>\forall x, \sim L(x)</m>.  Let <m>x</m> be a joke, <m>L(x)</m> denotes "the audience laughed at <m>x</m>".</li>
            <li> <m>\forall x, F(x)\to E(x)</m>  Let <m>x</m> be an integer, <m>F(x)</m> denotes "<m>x</m> is a mutliple of four", and <m>E(x)</m> denote "<m>x</m> is even".</li>
            <li> <m>\forall x, S(x)\wedge I(x)</m>   Let <m>x</m> be a linear function, <m>S(x)</m> denotes "<m>x</m> has a slope", <m>I(x)</m> denotes "<m>x</m> has a <m>y</m>-intercept".</li>
          </ol></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Consider these sentences:
          <ol>
            <li>"Each accordianist has a trained monkey."</li>
            <li>"No one laughed at any of the jokes."</li>
            <li> "For each integer, if it's a multiple of four, then it's even." </li>
            <li> "Each linear function has a slope and <m>y</m>-intercept."</li>

    <title> Exists </title>
    <p>
      The <term><m>\exists</m></term> pronounced
      <q>there exists</q>
      or
      <q>there is</q>
      indicates the following statement is true for some values of <m>x</m>.
      It could be true for 1 of them,
      or a bunch of them, or for all of them.
      The only thing we know for sure is that there is <em>at least</em> one value of <m>x</m> for which it is true.
      So <m>\exists x, I(x)</m> would mean
      <q>There is a State U student who likes ice cream.</q>
      or
      <q>At least one State U student likes ice cream.</q>  In order for a <m>\exists</m> statement to be true, it has to be true for at least one, possibly more, choice(s) of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, if <m>S(x)</m> is a statement about <m>x</m>, then <me> \exists x, S(x) </me> means that <m>S(x)</m> is true for at least one choice of <m>x</m>.

    <title>Negating Quantifiers</title>
    <p>
      Let's consider <m>\forall x,  I(x)</m> or
      <q>Every State U student likes ice Cream.</q>
      If this were <em>not</em> true, what would that mean?
      It would mean that there is some student at State U who does not like ice cream.
      In other words: <m>\exists x, \sim I(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the negation of <m>\exists x, I(x)</m> be?
      The statement is saying
      <q>There is a student who likes Ice Cream.</q>
      What would it mean for this not to be true?
      It would mean that every single student doesn't like Ice Cream,
      i.e.<nbsp/><m>\forall x,  \sim I(x)</m>.
      So our negation rules are:
      <md>
        <mrow>\sim(\forall x, p(x))\amp = \exists x,  \sim p(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>\sim(\exists x, p(x))\amp = \forall x, \sim p(x)</mrow>
      </md>

            <mrow>\amp = \exists x, \sim(\sim p(x)\vee q(x))</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \exists x, p(x)\wedge \sim q(x).</mrow>

      <title>Negation of a sentence</title>
    <statement>
        <p>Translate the sentence "Every real number is either positive or negative" into a logical statement, negate it, and then translate the negation back to a sentence.  Let  <m>x</m> be a real number, <m>P(x)</m> be "<m>x</m> is positive", and <m>N(x)</m> be "<m>x</m> is negative". </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p> The statement is "<m>\forall x, P(x)\vee N(x)</m>".  It's negation would be:
          <md>
            <mrow>\sim(\forall x, P(x)\vee N(x))\amp = \exists x, \sim (P(x)\vee N(x))</mrow>]
            <mrow>\amp = \exists x, \sim P(x)\wedge \sim N(x).</mrow>
          </md>
          This translates to "There is at least one number which is both not even and not odd".
      </p>
    </solution>

    <example>
      <title>Negation of a sentence pt. 2</title>
    <statement>
        <p>Translate the sentence "There is a function who if one evaluates it at zero, the output is negative" into a logical statement, negate it, and then translate the negation back to a sentence.  Let  <m>x</m> be a function, <m>I(x)</m> be "<m>x</m> is evaluated at 0", and <m>N(x)</m> be "<m>x</m> has a negative output". </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p> The statement is "<m>\exists x, I(x)\to N(x)</m>".  It's negation would be:
          <md>
            <mrow>\sim(\exists x, I(x)\to N(x))\amp = \forall x, \sim (I(x)\to N(x))</mrow>]
            <mrow>\amp = \forall x, \sim (\sim I(x)\vee N(x))</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \forall x, I(x)\wedge \sim N(x).</mrow>
          </md>
          This translates to "For every function, we evaluate at zero and the output is not negative".  (This isn't true, but it's the negation of the original statement).
