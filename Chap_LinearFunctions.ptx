  <title>Linear Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this Chapter, we will introduce the notion of a
      <term>linear function</term>.
      Linear functions are used to model a variety of situations,
      such as the the revenue generated by selling a product,
      conversion between units of measurement such as Fahrenheit to Celsius,
      distance traveled by an entity moving at a constant velocity,
      demand of a product relative to price and many more.
      It is also a good introduction to the theory of functions more generally.
