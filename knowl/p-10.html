<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The author acknowledges every student who had to choose between paying bills and purchasing textbooks, who had their engagement with their learning disrupted because they had to wait to purchase access to course materials, who had to drop out of courses because they could not afford the content.  The author also acknowledges every instructor who had to work around these obstacles, and who made special arrangements with their students, who wink-nudged themselves into legal grey-areas because they put their student's learning first.</p>
