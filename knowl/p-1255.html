<p>We should also note that even if one can opbtain a truly random sample, sheer chance itself can bias the results.  If we look at our die rolling example from <a href="Sec_ProbabilityDistributions.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.4: Probability Distrbutions">Section 9.4</a>: <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ngpuywqgug" id="interactive-199" width="600" height="600"></iframe> If I let the sample size just be 10, as I resample the distribution, I get very varied results in the shape of my outcomes, as well as the expectated values.  If I didn't apriori know what the outcome of die rolls would look like, or I didn't know the results came from die rolls, I could well  be convinced that this distribution had a much different shape than it actually does!  Generally speaking the larger the sample, the less likely we are to be fooled in this way.</p>
