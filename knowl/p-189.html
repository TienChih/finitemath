<p>In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Example_CorrQuizTest.html" title="Example 1.5.5">Example 1.5.5</a>, if I had simply given everyone 100 on the quizzes without looking at them, and graded the exams in normal way, they likely would not have done any better. One could argue that they would have done worse as a result. So a positive correlation between the variables doesn't mean that one will rise simply by virtue of the other rising.</p>
