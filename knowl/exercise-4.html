<p>Suppose that a agriculture student is raising goats and pigs for a project. The goal is to raise some animals and then sell them for profit. She can raise a total of at most 16 animals. It costs $25 per goat and $75 per pig, and she has a budget of $900. Finally, she doesn't particularly like goats, so she won't raise more than 10 of them. If the profit per goat is $12 and profit per pig is $40, how many of each should she raise to maximize profits?</p>
