<p>The <dfn class="terminology">\(\exists\)</dfn> pronounced “there exists” or “there is” indicates the following statement is true for some values of \(x\text{.}\) It could be true for 1 of them, or a bunch of them, or for all of them. The only thing we know for sure is that there is <em class="emphasis">at least</em> one value of \(x\) for which it is true. So \(\exists x, I(x)\) would mean “There is a State U student who likes ice cream.” or “At least one State U student likes ice cream.”  In order for a \(\exists\) statement to be true, it has to be true for at least one, possibly more, choice(s) of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
