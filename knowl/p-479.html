<p>Let's say you have a back account that gives you 2% monthly interest (lucky you!) and let's also say that from January to May, you deposit $100 each month. How much will you have in May? Well:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The 100 dollars you put in January would accrue interests for 4 months, so you'd have \(100(1.02)^4\) dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>The 100 dollars you put in February would accrue interests for 3 months, so you'd have \(100(1.02)^3\) dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>The 100 dollars you put in March would accrue interests for 2 months, so you'd have \(100(1.02)^2\) dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>The 100 dollars you put in April would accrue interests for 1 months, so you'd have \(100(1.02)^1\) dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>The 100 dollars you put in May would accrue interests for 0 months, so you'd have \(100(1.02)^0\) dollars.</p></li>
</ul>
