<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let's say someone votes for one of two political parties \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\)  Each election cycle, this person may vote for either of these parties.  But the probability that they vote for some party depends on how they voted last time, after all people are more likely to vote for the same party they did last time, but there's always some chance that they'll switch.  If they vote for party \(A\) this cycle, what's the probability that they do the cycle after next?  The one after that?  We answer these questions.</p>
