<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this chapter, we introduce the notion of Linear Systems. Linear Systems occur whenever we have collections of variables with linear relations with each other. For example, we may want to eat a diet which contains certain levels of protein and fiber, and we wonder how much chicken and kale we should eat to achieve this? Or we have Business, English and Math students, each of whom take different number of these courses, if we knew how many of each major there were, could we compute how many credits of each type of course would be taught? This chapter will focus on the techniques and tools to model and address these types of situations.</p>
