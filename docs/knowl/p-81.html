<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If we combined the two pieces of information from the start of the section, would we obtain a unique line? Intuitively this should make sense, there are infinitely many lines which go through a point, but only one with slope \(m=\frac{3}{2}\text{,}\) similarly, there are infinitely many lines with slope \(\frac{3}{2}\text{,}\) but they all pass through different points, only one of them passes through \((2,3)\text{.}\) Again to refer to our geometric ideas, if someone drew a point on a paper, and told you which direction you had to go from there, there's really only one line you could draw.</p>
