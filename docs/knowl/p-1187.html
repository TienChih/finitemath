<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this section, we consider how we might compute probabilities if you knew other events took place.  This occurs often in our day to day thinking without us being aware of it. It may be that the chance you have the flu on any random day is fairly low.  But if you woke up one morning, with a high fever and a cough, then certainly you'd think the chances were higher!  It may be difficult to predict the weather in general, but by observing signs like cloud cover, wind and changes in temperature, one could adjust your own assesment of the likelihood of rain.  In other words, the probablity of an event occuring may change depending on what other events do or don't take place.</p>
