<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now what happens if the child doesn't clean their room?  Nothing was stipulated about what the parent would do in this case so they can do whatever you want. They only said that they would do something if the child cleaned their room, no promises were made as to what they would do if the child didn't. So now whether or not the parent buy the chid\ld ice-cream, they've technically kept their promise. This may make them a pushover parent, depending, but it wouldn't make them a liar!</p>
