<p>The next fallacy is the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Fallacy of the Inverse</dfn>.  This supposes that you have an implication \(p\to q\) and then argues tht if \(p\) is false, than \(q\) must be false as well.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
p\to q \\
\sim p\\
\hline
\sim q
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

<p data-braille="continuation">So for example "If I order pizza, then I will have lunch.  I didn't order pizza, I must not have had lunch." The reason this is a fallacy is because it is clear that you could potentially have had anything else for lunch.  Without more knowledge, it can't be concluded based on this alone that you had no lunch options.  Recall that \(F\to q\) is always true no matter what \(q\) is.  So if you didn't get pizza, could have had lunch?  Yes.  Could you not have had lunch?  Also yes.  You simply can't conclude anything.</p>
