<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Adaeze sits a poker table, she's a savy player so in each game she has a 60% chance of winng \(\$100\) and a 40% chance of losing \(\$100\text{.}\)  Being a savy player, she also realizes that eventually she will lose everything unless, she walks away at some point.  Let's say she makes the choice to cash out when she has \(\$500\text{.}\)  If she hits \(\$0\) she has to bow out by default.  She's going to keep playing until one of these outcomes is reached.  What's the probability she walks out happy?  Sad?</p>
